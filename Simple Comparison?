Write a function that will compare two values, one will be a number and one will be a string. Return true if they are the same character (regardless of their different data types) and return false if they are not.

To make this challange harder and to promp the challenger to read up about coercion I have disabled some of the built in methods including .toString(), .join(), .split(), parseInt and .Number().

	//1st input is one number 2nd input is one string 
  //return true if same character (regardless of type) return false if not 


function add(a, b){
  return a == b;
}

//We aren't allowed to use methods to normalize the input so I used implicit return to return true if they are the same character regardless of type
//The equality operator performs type coercion so regardless of the type it will compare the character
//If you put in like charcaters it should return true and different characters should return false
