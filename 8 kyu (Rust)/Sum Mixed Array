Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers.

Return your answer as a number.


// We can use the Either crate provided in the function so that if it's an i32 (Left) deference the value, and if it's a String (Right) parse the value.

use either::Either;

fn sum_mix(arr: &[Either<i32, String>]) -> i32 {

    arr.iter().map(|num| match num {
        Either::Left(n) => *n,
        Either::Right(s) => s.parse().unwrap_or(0),
        }).sum()
}
