Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).


// Iterate array and check if current element is truthy, if yes add 1 to result.


fn count_sheep(sheep: &[bool]) -> u8 {
    
  let mut result = 0;
    
    for &animal in sheep {
        if animal {
         result += 1;
        }
    }
    result
}
