Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

// We can solve this by looping the vector and accumulating the sum of each number's square. 



fn square_sum(vec: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    let mut sum = 0;
   for num in &vec {
       sum += num * num;
    }
    sum
}
