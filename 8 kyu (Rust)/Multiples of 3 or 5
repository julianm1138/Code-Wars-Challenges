Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

// We can solve this iterateively by checking if each integer is divisible by 3 or 5, or we can also solve it with the sum of arthimetic series formula.


// Iterative solution
fn solution(num: i32) -> i32 {
  let mut sum = 0;
  for i in 0..num {
      if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
          sum += i;
      }  
    }
     sum
}
