Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

// We can implement this using match which checks the input and completes a function if the input matches.



fn basic_op(operator: char, value1: i32, value2: i32) -> i32 {
    
   match operator {
       '+' => value1 + value2,
       '-' => value1 - value2, 
       '*' => value1 * value2, 
       '/' => value1 / value2, 
       _ => panic!("Unsupported operator: {}", operator),
    }
}
