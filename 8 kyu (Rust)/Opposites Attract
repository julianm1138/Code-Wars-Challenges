Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

// We can solve this by checking if either flower is even or odd for both scenarios: either flower 1 is even and flower 2 is odd OR flower 1 is odd and flower 2 is even.
// In other words, if they are the same parity we return false, else return true. A regular check would be incorrect for this problem so we negate it !=


fn lovefunc(flower1: u16, flower2: u16) -> bool {
    flower1 % 2 != flower2 % 2
}
