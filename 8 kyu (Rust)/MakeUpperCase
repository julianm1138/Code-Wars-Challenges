Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

//ASCII is for English letters and other non-language specific characters
//Unicode is for all language and non-language specific characters


fn make_upper_case(s: &str) -> String {
    s.to_uppercase()
}

//or 

fn make_upper_case(s: &str) -> String {
    s.to_ascii_uppercase()
}
//This is more efficient if we are assuming there are non-english language characters inputted because it only checks what is necessary resulting in less parsing and overhead
