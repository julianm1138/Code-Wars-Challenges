Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.


// We can solve this by looping through the string and pushing any characters that are not at the first or last index to the result.


pub fn remove_char(s: &str) -> String {

    let mut result = String::new();
   
   for (i, c) in s.chars().enumerate() {
       
     if i != 0 && i != s.len() - 1 {
         result.push(c);
       }
 }
    result
}
