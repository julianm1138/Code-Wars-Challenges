The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second century - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

// year / 100 returns the correct answer for years that are divisible by 100, othewise we need to round up.



fn century(year: u32) -> u32 {
  
    if year % 100 == 0 {
        year / 100
    } else {
        year / 100 + 1
    }
}
