In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?


// If the integer is already negative, return the value as is else return the negative signed version of the integer.




fn make_negative(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 0 {
        n
    } else {
        -n
    }  
}
