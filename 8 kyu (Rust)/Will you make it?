You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.

Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.

Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.


// The distance to the pump divided by the gallons given will give us the rate we need to make the trip home. 
// mpg is the rate our car can travel. 
// Comparing what we need to what we have, if what we need is less than or equal to what we have we will make it home.



fn zero_fuel(distance_to_pump: u32, mpg: u32, gallons: u32) -> bool {
  distance_to_pump / gallons <= mpg
}
