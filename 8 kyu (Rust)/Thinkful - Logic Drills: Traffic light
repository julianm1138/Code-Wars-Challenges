You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.


// We can solve this with match and returning the strings conditionally. 


fn update_light(current: &str) -> String {
     
    
    match current {
        "green" => "yellow".to_string(),
        "yellow" => "red".to_string(),
        "red" => "green".to_string(),
        _ => panic!("Error"),
    }
}
