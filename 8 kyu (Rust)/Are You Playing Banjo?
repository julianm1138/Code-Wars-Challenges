Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
Names given are always valid strings.

// Since "R" and "r" are the same letter we can convert to lowercase and use starts_with method


fn are_you_playing_banjo(name: &str) -> String {
    
    if name.to_lowercase().starts_with("r") {
        format!("{} plays banjo", name)
    } else {
        format!("{} does not play banjo", name)
    }
    
}
