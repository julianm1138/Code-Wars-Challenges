Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively. Each function returns one number.

// We can use min() and max() which return Options and unwrap them with expect(). 


fn minimum(arr: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    *arr.iter().min().expect("Please input valid array")
    
}

fn maximum(arr: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    *arr.iter().max().expect("Please input valid array")
    
}
