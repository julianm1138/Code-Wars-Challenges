Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

patrick feeney => P.F


// We can solve this by collecting the first initials for the input into a Vector, converting to uppercase and joining them with a "."





fn abbrev_name(name: &str) -> String {
   
    let result: Vec<String> = name  //define type annotation 
    .split_whitespace()             //split by whitespace
    .filter_map(|word| word.chars().next())    //get the first character of each word
    .map(|c| c.to_uppercase().collect())    //convert each character to uppercase and collect into a string
    .collect();                     //collect into a Vector
    
    format!("{}", result.join("."))  //join Vector with period 

}
