Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

// We can solve this by looping up to count and concatenating the source string to te result.



fn repeat_str(src: &str, count: usize) -> String {
  let mut result = String::new();
    
  for _ in 0..count {
      result += src;
    }
    result
}
