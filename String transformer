Given a string, return a new string that has transformed based on the input:

Change case of every character, ie. lower case to upper case, upper case to lower case.
Reverse the order of words from the input.
Note: You will have to handle multiple spaces, and leading/trailing spaces.

For example:

"Example Input" ==> "iNPUT eXAMPLE"
You may assume the input only contain English alphabet and spaces.

//We can solve this by switching the current letter casing of each string and then reversing that string.
//Loop through the string and if the current character is lower case, add its upper case version to the new string, else we will add the lowercase version because the only other possibility is that the character is uppercase.
//Split with spaces as delimiters, reverse array, join by spaces.


function stringTransformer(str) {
  
  let switchCasing = '';
  for (let char of str) {
    if (char === char.toLowerCase()) {
      switchCasing += char.toUpperCase();
    } else {
    switchCasing += char.toLowerCase();
    } 
  }
  const result = switchCasing.split(' ').reverse().join(' ');
  return result;
}
