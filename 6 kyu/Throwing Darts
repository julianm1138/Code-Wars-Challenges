Scoring specifications:

0 points - radius above 10
5 points - radius between 5 and 10 inclusive
10 points - radius less than 5
If all radii are less than 5, award 100 BONUS POINTS!

Write a function that accepts an array of radii (can be integers and/or floats), and returns a total score using the above specification.

An empty array should return 0.

Examples:
scoreThrows( [1, 5, 11] )    =>  15
scoreThrows( [15, 20, 30] )  =>  0
scoreThrows( [1, 2, 3, 4] )  =>  140

// We can solve this by defining two loops, one to check if all are less than five with booleans, and the other to check the conditions of 5 and 10 inclusive and less than 5 and accumulate the sum of points based on the conditions.
// If the flag is true add 100 to the sum.

function scoreThrows(radii){

  if (radii.length === 0) return 0;

  let sum = 0;
  
  let allLessThanFive = true; 

  for (let i = 0; i < radii.length; i++) {
    if (radii[i] >= 5) {
      allLessThanFive = false; 
    }
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < radii.length; i++) {
    
      if (radii[i] >= 5 && radii[i] <= 10) {
        sum += 5;
        }
      if (radii[i] < 5) {
        sum += 10;
      } 
    }
  if (allLessThanFive) {
    sum += 100;
  }
  return sum;
  }
console.log(scoreThrows([0, 5, 10, 10.5, 4.5]))
