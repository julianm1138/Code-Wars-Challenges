There's no such thing as private properties on a coffeescript object! But, maybe there are?

Implement a function createSecretHolder(secret) which accepts any value as secret and returns an object with ONLY two methods

getSecret() which returns the secret
setSecret() which sets the secret



//We can create an object in the function scope and use two methods: one to return the function's argument and one to set secret to a new value.




function createSecretHolder(secret) {

  const secretObj = {
    
    getSecret() {
      return secret;
    },
    
    setSecret(newSecret) {
      
    secret = newSecret;
   }
}

  return secretObj;
}
