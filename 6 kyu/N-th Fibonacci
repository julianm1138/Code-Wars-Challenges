I would like for you to write me a function that, when given a number n (n >= 1 ), returns the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

//We can solve this by creating a fibonacci sequence up to and including n and then reurning the element index equal to n.
//Define the mutable array with the first two fibonacci numbers.
//While the length of the array is less than or equal to n generate the next number using the formula (n - 1) + (n - 2). 
//Index into the array and adjust the index as needed to get the correct number for n. 



function nthFibo(n) {

    let seq = [0, 1];
  
    while (seq.length <= n) {
    let next = seq[seq.length - 1] + seq[seq.length - 2];
    seq.push(next);
  }
  return seq[n - 1];
}
console.log(nthFibo(5))
