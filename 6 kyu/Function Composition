Your task is to create a compose function to carry out this task, which will be passed two functions or lambdas. Ruby functions will be passed, and should return, either a proc or a lambda. Remember that the resulting composed function may be passed multiple arguments!


//Given the information about composition of functions f3(a) = f1(f2(a))     f3 takes a universal argument (a) that will pass through f1 and f2. 
//So we just need to define f3, which takes f1 and f2 as arguments and return f2 (g) nested inside f1 (f), and nest the universal argument inside of g. Use spread operator for cases of multiple arguments.




function compose(f,g) {
  
  return function(...x) {
    return f(g(...x));
  }
}
