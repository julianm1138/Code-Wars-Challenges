//To create a function that generates a tribonacci sequence, we need to loop to n and generate a list of numbers that is equal to the formula F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) + F(n -3)
//We can define our result to span from the signature to n, and the result is always the signature to start with.
//Then our loop will start at the last element in the signature (i = 3) and assign each element in the signature to be the sum of the last three elements, using the formula.




function tribonacci(signature, n) {

    let result = signature.slice(0, n);
  
    for (let i = 3; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i - 3];
    }
    
    return result;

console.log(tribonacci([1,1,1], 10))
