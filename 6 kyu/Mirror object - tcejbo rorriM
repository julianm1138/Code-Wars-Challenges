Mirror - Mirror
Can you mirror the properties on an object?

Given an object with properties with no value

abc: -
arara: -
xyz: -
Return a new object that have the properties with its mirrored key!

abc: cba
arara: arara
xyz: zyx


// We can solve this by returning a new object where each value is the original object's key reversed. 




const mirror = obj => {
  
  let newObject = {};
  
  for (let key in obj) {
    let mirroredKey = key.split('').reverse().join('');
    newObject[key] = mirroredKey;
  }
  
  return newObject;
};
