Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.

You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.
The array will always contain letters in only one case.


//We can solve this by creating a string of lowercase and uppercase alphabets and defining a start index that is the first element of the input array within the letters string.
//From there we can loop through the array and check if the current letter is not equal to the next letter in the letters string.





function findMissingLetter(array){
  
  const letters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
  
  const startIndex = letters.indexOf(array[0]);
  
  
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    if(array[i] !== letters[startIndex + i]){
      return letters[startIndex + i];
    }
  }
  
  
}
