You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.

//We can solve this by removing the odd numbers from the original array, sorting them, and then inserting them back into the original array.
//To do this we can make a new array of odd elements and sort it. Then we can loop through the original array and replace each odd element with the element from the array of odd elements.
//We need to define our own index for the odd array and increment on each iteration to stay within bounds.


function sortArray(array) {
  
 let result = [];
 let oddArr = array.filter(element => element % 2 !== 0).sort((a, b) => a - b);
 let oddIndex = 0;
  
 for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
   if(array[i] % 2 !== 0){
     result.push(oddArr[oddIndex]);
     oddIndex ++;
    } else {
      result.push(array[i]);
    }
}
  return result;
  }
console.log(sortArray([5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]))
