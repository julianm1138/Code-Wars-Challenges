It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]


//We can iterate through the first array and keep all elements that are not included in the second array. 
//We can use filter or a for loop;




function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  
  return a.filter(element => !b.includes(element));
  
}
