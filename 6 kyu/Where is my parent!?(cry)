-Uppercase letters stands for mothers, lowercase stand for their children, i.e. "A" mother's children are "aaaa".
-Function input: String contains only letters, uppercase letters are unique.
Task:
Place all people in alphabetical order where Mothers are followed by their children, i.e. "aAbaBb" => "AaaBbb".

//We can solve this by sorting the input into alphabetical order.
//Convert each character to lowercase inside the sort function to check for cases where they are equal inside the original array.
//Due to ASCII values of lowercase being greater than ASCII values for uppercase every time, even if the characters are the same, the test a < b return -1 will be the correct order every time. This is because the condition, no matter whether a or b are any combination of upper or lowercase, the ASCII values will cause the corresponding value to be placed in the correct order. 
//The ASCII values are the key.
//Else we want to do a sort by ASCII values and check if a < b and return a (-1) if true else return b (1)
