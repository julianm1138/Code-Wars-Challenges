How many deaf rats are there?

Legend
P = The Pied Piper
O~ = Rat going left
~O = Rat going right
Example
ex1 ~O~O~O~O P has 0 deaf rats

ex2 P O~ O~ ~O O~ has 1 deaf rat

ex3 ~O~O~O~OP~O~OO~ has 2 deaf rats

// This problem has everything to do with the order of the rats and the piper. 
// If the piper is before the rat, deaf rats would be "O"
// If the piper is after the rat, deaf rats would be "~"
// Therefore when we reach P in the string, we assign ident to be "~" otherwise it should be "O".
// Increment by an extra position since every rat is of length 2.

//In other words, the ident is the thing that changes as we loop through the string. It changes when we get to P.

var countDeafRats = function(town) {
  let deafs = 0
  let ident = 'O'
  for ( let i = 0; i < town.length; i++){
     if ( town[i] === 'P' ){
      ident =  '~'
     }
     if (town[i] === ident){                
       deafs++
     }
     if (town[i] === '~' || town[i] === 'O'){
      i++
     }
   }
  return deafs;
}
