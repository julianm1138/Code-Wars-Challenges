Assume "#" is like a backspace in string. This means that string "a#bc#d" actually is "bd"

Your task is to process a string with "#" symbols.

//We can solve this using a stack. 
//We loop through the string and check if the character is '#'. If so, that means the last character added to the stack should not be included in the result.
//Else we add the character like normal. This should remove every pair where the second element is '#' from the stack.


function cleanString(s) {
    
    let stack = [];

    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '#') {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }
    return stack.join('');
}
