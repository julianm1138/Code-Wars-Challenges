Define a function that takes an integer argument and returns a logical value true or false depending on if the integer is a prime.

Per Wikipedia, a prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

//All primes numbers are greater than 1, and have no divisors between 1 and itself.
//so we can solve this by going from the starting point (2) to the square root of the input to create an efficient range.
//We are looking for numbers that are divisible so we can return false which only leaves true for prime numbers. 






function isPrime(num) {

  if(num < 2){
    return false;
  }
  
 for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
   if (num % i === 0){
     return false;
   }
 }
  return true;
}
