Your task is to implement a function that would take the morse code as input and return a decoded human-readable string.

//MORSE_CODE[] dictionary comes built in to JS so we can access each key by iterating the string and looking up each character in the dictionary.
//We just need to split it by spaces because the dictionary needs to look up each individual character and sometimes charcaters may be grouped together.
//The other issue is that sometimes there will be empty strings because there may be more than one space between charcaters.
//To fix this we can add a space instead of empty string where there are empty strings and use a regex and trim to remove all spaces and whitespace characters.



decodeMorse = function(morseCode){
  
  let result = '';
  
  const chars = morseCode.split(' ');
  
  for(let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++){
    
    if(chars[i] === ''){
      result += ' ';
    } else {
      result += MORSE_CODE[chars[i]];
    }
  }
  result = result.replace(/ +/g, ' ').trim();
  
   return result
}
console.log(decodeMorse('.... . -.--   .--- ..- -.. .'))
