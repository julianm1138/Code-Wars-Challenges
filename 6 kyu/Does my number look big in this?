Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10.


A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. 
In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

//We can solve this by getting the (length of the number) power of each individual digit, and then summing those values.
//Split the value into an array of strings.
//Create an array of the values.length power of each number.
//Sum those values.
//Implicit return. We have to join the value back into a string because we assigned the value to be an array initially.






function narcissistic(value) {
  
  value = value.toString().split('');

  const powerArr = value.map(element => element**(value.length));
  
  const sum = powerArr.reduce((acc, currVal) => acc + currVal, 0);
  
  return value.join('') === sum.toString();
}
console.log(narcissistic(153))
