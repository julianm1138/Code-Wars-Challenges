You are provided with consecutive elements of an Arithmetic Progression. There is however one hitch: exactly one term from the original series is missing from the set of numbers which have been given to you. The rest of the given series is the same as the original AP. Find the missing term.

//We can solve this using the AP formula: (first element  + last element) * (array.length / 2)
//That formula should give us the expected sum including the missing element of the progression.
//So we just need to subtract the expected sum from the current sum.





var findMissing = function (list) {

  const totalSum = list.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
  const expectedSum = (list[0] + list[list.length - 1]) * (list.length + 1) / 2;

  return expectedSum - totalSum;
};

console.log(findMissing([1, 3, 5, 9, 11]));
