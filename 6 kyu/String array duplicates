In this Kata, you will be given an array of strings and your task is to remove all consecutive duplicate letters from each string in the array.

For example:

dup(["abracadabra","allottee","assessee"]) = ["abracadabra","alote","asese"].

dup(["kelless","keenness"]) = ["keles","kenes"].

Strings will be lowercase only, no spaces. See test cases for more examples.

Good luck!

//We can solve this by looping over the array of strings and then each string inside the array. Then check if the current character in the string is equal to the last one. 
//If the current character is equal to the last one that means it is a duplicate character so this condition does nothing. Else add the character. 
// Push each str created to the result array.




function dup(s) {
  
  let result = [];
  
  for (const string of s) {
    
    let str = '';
    
    for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
      if (string[i] === string[i - 1]) { 
      } else {
        str += string[i];     
      } 
    }
   result.push(str);
  }
   return result;
};

console.log(dup(["abracadabra","allottee","assessee"]))
