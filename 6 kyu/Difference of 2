The objective is to return all pairs of integers from a given array of integers that have a difference of 2.

The result array should be sorted in ascending order of values.

Assume there are no duplicate integers in the array. The order of the integers in the input array should not matter.


//We can solve this by looping over the array and then taking each of the elements and subtracting them by each of the other elements.
//Run them through a conditional check for the difference of 2. We use absolute value in case there are negative integers in the array.
//Sort the array of differences in the outer level and then use map to sort the inner level. 




function twosDifference(input) {
  let arr = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < input.length; j++) {
      if (Math.abs(input[i]) - Math.abs(input[j]) === 2) {
        arr.push([input[i], input[j]]);
      }
    }
  }
  
  const result = arr
    .sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0])
    .map(subArr => subArr.sort((a, b) => a - b));

  return result;
}

console.log(twosDifference([1,2,3,4]))
