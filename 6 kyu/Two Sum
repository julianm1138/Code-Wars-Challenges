Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. 
The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

//We can solve this by noticing that if you subtract an element from the target and if it equals any other numbers in the array, then the sum of those two elements is the target.
//All we need to do is loop through the array twice, make sure the current element is not equal to the next element, and return the indices of the those two elements. 




function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      
      if (i !== j && (target - numbers[i]) === numbers[j]) {
        
        return [i, j];
      }
    }
  }
}
