Task
zipWith ( or zip_with ) takes a function and two arrays and zips the arrays together, applying the function to every pair of values.
The function value is one new array.

If the arrays are of unequal length, the output will only be as long as the shorter one.
(Values of the longer array are simply not used.)

Inputs should not be modified.

//We can solve this by looping through each array input concurrently and passing each of their elements into the function. 
//To avoid out of bounds errors we can use Math.min to make sure the loop only runs for the smallest array's length. 


function zipWith(fn,a0,a1) {
  
  let result = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(a0.length, a1.length); i++) {
    result.push(fn(a0[i], a1[i]));
  }
  return result;
}
