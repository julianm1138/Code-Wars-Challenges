In this kata, you will sort elements in an array by decreasing frequency of elements. If two elements have the same frequency, sort them by increasing value.

solve([2,3,5,3,7,9,5,3,7]) = [3,3,3,5,5,7,7,2,9]
-- We sort by highest frequency to lowest frequency.
-- If two elements have same frequency, we sort by increasing value

/* We can solve this by storing the frequency of each number, creating an array of [number, frequency], 
sorting that by highest to lowest frequency (index 1 of each subarray), else sort in ascending order by number (index 0 of each subarray).
Last, build the result array by filling it with the num frequency times
