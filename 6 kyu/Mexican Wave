Task
In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an 
uppercase letter is a person standing up. 
Rules
 1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.

 2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat


//We can solve this by looping through the string's characters and checking if each one is not a space.
//If not, we add subtrings starting from the first index to i + the current character to upper case + subtring i + 1 to create our new array.



function wave(str){
  

  let result = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
   if (str[i] !== ' '){
     result.push(str.substring(0, i) + str[i].toUpperCase() +  str.substring(i + 1))
   }
  }
  return result;
}
console.log(wave("two words"))
