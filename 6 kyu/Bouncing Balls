A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor above ground level, h, is known.

He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing)?

//While the height is greater than the height the window is located we can increment the pass by 1 and run the loop based on the factor of the bounce.
//We create an if statement to count the subsequent passes. 




function bouncingBall(h, bounce, window) {
  
  if (h <= 0 || bounce <= 0 || bounce >= 1 || window >= h) {
    return -1;
  }
  
  let passes = 0;

  while (h > window) {
    passes += 1; 
    h *= bounce;
    if (h > window) {
      passes += 1; 
    }
  }

  return passes;
}

console.log(bouncingBall(3.0, 0.66, 1.5));
