In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

//To solve this problem we can index the charCode value by subtracting 96 from the character code, because the lowercase alphabet starts at 97 in ASCII.
//Then we set the input to all lowercase to only use the lowercase alphabet in ASCII.
//Looping through the string, if the current character of the string is a letter we want to create an array of the indexed values. This is to avoid pushing any values that are not letters to the array. 





function alphabetPosition(text) {
  
  text = text.toLowerCase();
  
  const letter = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
  let resultArr = [];
  
  for(let i = 0; i < text.length; i++){
  if (letter.includes(text[i])){
     resultArr.push(text[i].charCodeAt() - 96);
    }
  }
 return resultArr.join(" ");
}
console.log(alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve"))
