A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.


//To check if the string is a panagram we have to check if it has every letter in the alphabet.
//We can create an array of every letter in the alphabet and then use .every() on it to check if the string has every character in the alphabet array. 





function isPangram(string){
 
  return 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.split('')
  .every(character => string.toLowerCase().includes(character));
  
}
