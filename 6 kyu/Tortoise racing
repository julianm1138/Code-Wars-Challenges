720 feet per hour. Young B knows she runs faster than A, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B's speed is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take B to catch A?

More generally: given two speeds v1 (A's speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B's speed, integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?

//We can solve this by calculating the relative speed difference, the total seconds, and then using totalseconds to calculate the hours, minutes, and seconds.
//Use math.floor as needed



function race(v1, v2, g) {
  
  const relSpeed = v2 - v1; 

  const totalSeconds = Math.floor(g * 3600 / relSpeed);

  const hours = Math.floor(totalSeconds / 3600);
  const minutes = Math.floor((totalSeconds % 3600) / 60);
  const seconds = totalSeconds % 60;
  
  return [hours, minutes, seconds];
}
