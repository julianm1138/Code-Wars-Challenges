If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

//First we take care of the edge case where the number is negative.
//Next we can loop from 1 up to the number and for each i check for mutliples of 3 or 5.
//Last use reduce to get the sum of multiples.




function solution(number){
  
  let multiples = [];
  
  if(number < 0){
    return 0;
  }
  
  for(let i = 1; i < number; i++){
    if(i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0){
      multiples.push(i)
    }
  }
  return multiples.reduce((acc, currVal) => acc + currVal, 0);
}
console.log(solution(10))
