There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

input
customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.
output
The function should return an integer, the total time required.



//We can solve this by simulating and balancing the time in the tills.
//We can create an array of n length and initilaize with 0's.
//Loop through the customers array to keep track of the minValue and its index.
//Loop through the tills array to get the minIndex.
//Add the next iteration of the customer's time to the till with the least time.
//This will balance the tills and the max value 






function queueTime(customers, n) {
  
  let tills = Array(n).fill(0);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
    let minValue = tills[0];
    let minIndex = 0;
    
    for (let j = 0; j < tills.length; j++) {
      if (tills[j] < minValue) {
        minValue = tills[j];
        minIndex = j;
      }
    }
    tills[minIndex] += customers[i];
  }
  return Math.max(...tills);
}

console.log(queueTime([2,2,3,3,4,4], 2))
