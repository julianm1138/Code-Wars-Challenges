Examples:
findNb(1071225) --> 45

findNb(91716553919377) --> -1

//We need to find how many cubes are needed in a sequence of n ** 3 + (n - 1) ** 3 + 1 ** 3 to equal m, else return -1. 
//We can solve this by starting n at 0 and keeping track of the sum of n cubed. 
//When the sum reaches m we can return the number where it does, else return -1.
