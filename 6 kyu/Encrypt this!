Your message is a string containing space separated words.
You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
The first letter must be converted to its ASCII code.
The second letter must be switched with the last letter
Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in the input.

//We can solve this by using conditional checks for each word length to construct our strings.
//The first possibility is the word length is 1 so we just need the charCode as a string.
//The second possibility is word length is 2 so we take converted first letter and join it with the second letter.
//The only other possibility is the word length is > 2 so we will construct a new string by concatenating the last letter + with the sliced word from 2 to -1 + the second letter.



var encryptThis = function(text) {
  
  const strArr = text.split(' ');
  
  let arr = [];
  
  for (const word of strArr) {
    
      if (word.length === 1) {
   arr.push(word[0].charCodeAt().toString());
        
  } else if (word.length === 2) {
      arr.push(word[0].charCodeAt().toString() + word.charAt(1))
  
    } else {
    const newSecondLetter = word.charAt(word.length - 1);
    const newLastLetter = word.charAt(1);                                     
     arr.push((word[0].charCodeAt() + ( newSecondLetter + word.slice(2, -1) + newLastLetter )));
    } 
}
  return arr.join(' ');
}
console.log(encryptThis("A wise old owl lived in an oak"))
