There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55


//We need to return the unique number, and we can do this by using filter to return the elements for whose first index is equal to their last index.








function findUniq(arr) {
  
  return Number(arr.filter(element => arr.indexOf(element) === arr.lastIndexOf(element)));
}
