Your task is to write a higher order function for chaining together a list of unary functions. In other words, it should return a function that does a left fold on the given functions.

chained([a,b,c,d])(input)
Should yield the same result as

d(c(b(a(input))))

// We can solve this with reduce by taking an input and calling it inside each function in the array of functions, accumulating each result. Use the input as the starting value for the accumulator. 


function chained(functions) {
  
  return function(input) {
    return functions.reduce((acc, currFn) => (currFn(acc)), input);
  };
}
