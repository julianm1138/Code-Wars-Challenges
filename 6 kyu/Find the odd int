Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times


//All we have to do is keep a count of every element in the array and if the count is odd, return that element.
//We can do this by creating an object to keep track of each element's count. 
//To make the object we can loop through the array and assign each array element as the object's property (counts[element]) and assign each value to be the count.
//We assign the value by using (counts[element] || 0) + 1   which says if the property is the array element or if the property is 0, add 1 to the property's value.
//Lastly we can loop through our object's keys and if the value is odd, we return the property as a number.

function findOdd(array) {

  let counts = {};
  
  for(let element of array){
    counts[element] = (counts[element] || 0) + 1; 
  }

  for(let key in counts){
    if(counts[key] % 2 === 1){
      return Number([key])
    }
  }
}
console.log(findOdd([1, 1, 2]))
