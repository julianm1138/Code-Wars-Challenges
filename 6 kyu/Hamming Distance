The Hamming Distance is a measure of similarity between two strings of equal length. Complete the function so that it returns the number of positions where the input strings do not match.

// Since the strings are of equal length we can solve this by comparing each string one character at a time, and when we run across any characters not equal to each other, increment the count.




const hamming = (a, b) => {
  
  let result = 0;
	
  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    if (a[i] !== b[i]) {
      result++;
    }
  }
    return result;
}
