Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized 
(known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.

Examples
"the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"

"The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"

"The_Stealth-Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"


//There is the possibility that we see a string with both dashes and underscores, so it would be a good idea to change all delimiters to one type.
//We can do this using a regex and we will replace all underscores with a dash.
//Then we split each string based on the dash to split each word into an array based on the dash delimiters. 
//Then we create a new array where the first element is as is because the first word should be capitalized only if the original was capitalized.
//The second condition is to uppercase the first letter of each word and replace the first element of each array element with that uppercase letter.



function toCamelCase(str){
  
  str = str.replace(/_/g, '-');
  
  let arr = str.split('-');
  
 const resultArr = arr.map((element, index) => {
    if(index === 0){
    return element;
    } else {
     return element[0].toUpperCase() + element.slice(1);
    }
  })
 
 return resultArr.join('');
}
