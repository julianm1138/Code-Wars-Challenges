Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0)

//We can use the numbers in the string as indices to correctly order the array. The only thing we need to do is extract the numbers from each string.
//Then we can assign each string to be a specific position/index in an empty array, based on the number. We just have to subtract 1 to get a 0 indexed result.  


function order(words) {
  let wordArray = words.split(' ');
  let orderedWords = [];

  wordArray.forEach(word => {
    let num = parseInt(word.replace(/\D/g, ''));
    orderedWords[num - 1] = word;
  });

  return orderedWords.join(' ');
}
