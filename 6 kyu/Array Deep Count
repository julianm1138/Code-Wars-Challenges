You are given an array. Complete the function that returns the number of ALL elements within an array, including any nested arrays.

//We can solve this by recursively counting the nested arrays and updating the count (arr.length).
//Check if the current element is an array, and if so we call deepCount with that element which will add the current length to the count.
//So we're just looping through the array and adding up the array lengths.



function deepCount(arr) {
  let count = arr.length; 

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (Array.isArray(arr[i])) {
      
      count += deepCount(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  return count;
}

console.log(deepCount([[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]])); // Output: 8
