Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

//To solve this, we can split the string into an array of strings/words, loop through the array of words, and loop through each character in each word.
//Then we can get the sum of each group of characters/sum of each word by using the inner loop to add the charCode value - 96 for each char of each word.
//Then we can start the highest score at the lowest value before being < 0, and make a condition where if the sum of the current element is the greatest sum, we reassign the highest score variable to be the greatest sum.
//Finally we assign the result to be the element of the highest sum.



function high(x){

  const strArr = x.split(' ');
  
  let highestScore = 0;
  let result = '';
  
  for (let element of strArr){
    
    let sum = 0;
    
    for (let char of element){
      sum += char.charCodeAt() - 96;
    }
    if(sum > highestScore){
      highestScore = sum;
      result = element;
    } 
  }  
return result;
  
}
