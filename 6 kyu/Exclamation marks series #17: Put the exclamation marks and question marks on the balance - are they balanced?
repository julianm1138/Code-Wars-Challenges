Each exclamation mark's weight is 2; each question mark's weight is 3. Putting two strings left and right on the balance - are they balanced?

If the left side is more heavy, return "Left"; if the right side is more heavy, return "Right"; if they are balanced, return "Balance".

Examples
"!!", "??"     -->  "Right"
"!??", "?!!"   -->  "Left"
"!?!!", "?!?"  -->  "Left"
"!!???!????", "??!!?!!!!!!!"  -->  "Balance"


//We can solve this by using variables to count the occurences of marks on the two right arguments and multiply each one by their given weights. 
//Then we just need to get the total of the left marks and right marks and compare them.



function balance(left,right){
  
  let leftExclamationCount = 0;
  let leftQuestionMarkCount = 0;
  let rightExclamationCount = 0;
  let rightQuestionMarkCount = 0;
  
  for (const char of left) {
    if (char === "!") leftExclamationCount += 1 * 2;
    if (char === "?") leftQuestionMarkCount += 1 * 3;  
  }

  for (const char of right) {
    if (char === "!") rightExclamationCount += 1 * 2;
    if (char === "?")  rightQuestionMarkCount += 1 * 3;
  }
  
  let totalLeft = leftExclamationCount + leftQuestionMarkCount;
  let totalRight = rightExclamationCount + rightQuestionMarkCount;
  
  return totalLeft > totalRight ? "Left" : totalLeft < totalRight ? "Right" : "Balance";

}
console.log(balance("!!","??"))
