You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

Examples
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] -->  11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] --> 160 (the only even number)


//If there is only one odd number in the array, or if there is only one even number in the array, return that only outlier.
//We can create an array of only the outlier in each case and then return it.
//So in the case of an array of mostly even numbers we need the odd number, and vice versa.
//We can create each array of only the outlier using filter and then a condition to check if the length of each variable equal to 1 to return the outlier. 






function findOutlier(integers) {
  let evenNumbers = integers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
  let oddNumbers = integers.filter(num => num % 2 !== 0);

  if (evenNumbers.length === 1) {
    return evenNumbers[0];
  } else {
    return oddNumbers[0];
  }
}
