The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more 
than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

Examples
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))((" 


//We need to check if the current element is a duplicate and if so, add "(" to an empty string, otherwise add ")".
//We can loop through the string and check if the character is unique. 



function duplicateEncode(word){
  
  word = word.toLowerCase();
  
  let result = "";
  
  for(let i = 0; i < word.length; i++){
    if(word.indexOf(word[i]) === word.lastIndexOf(word[i])){
      result += "("
    } else {
      result += ")"
    }
  }
    return result;
}
console.log((duplicateEncode("recede")))
