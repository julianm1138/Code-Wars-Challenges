You are given an array(list) strarr of strings and an integer k. Your task is to return the first longest string consisting of k consecutive strings taken in the array.


//To get the first lognest string consisting of k consecutive strings from the array we can loop from 0 to array.length - k to stay within bounds.
//Then we can create our concatenated strings up to k using slice and join. k acts as elements of the array.
//Finally, we can use a conditional to check if the current string length is the greatest out of all the strings we create. 
//If so, we assign the longest string to be the one with the longest length.




function longestConsec(strarr, k) {
  
  if (k <= 0) {
    return '';
  }
  
  let longestStr = '';
  
  let maxLength = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i <= strarr.length - k; i++) {
    let currentStr = strarr.slice(i, i + k).join('');
  
    if (currentStr.length > maxLength) {
      maxLength = currentStr.length;
      longestStr = currentStr;
    }
  }
  return longestStr;
}
