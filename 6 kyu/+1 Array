Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

the array can't be empty
only non-negative, single digit integers are allowed
Return nil (or your language's equivalent) for invalid inputs.

//We can solve this by handling two cases: the first is when the digit is less than 9 and the other is when the digit is greater than 9.
//We make a copy of the array and loop from the end to the front.
//If the digit is less than 9 we add 1 to the digit.
//If the digit is greater than 9 we set that digit to 0 and make a new array where 1 is the first element and input the rest of the 0's to be the rest of the array. 



function upArray(arr){
  
  
  for (const num of arr) {
    if (num < 0) {
      return null;
    } else if (num > 9) {
      return null;
    } else if (arr.length === 0) {
      return null;
    } 
  }
  
let result = [...arr];

  for (let i = result.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (result[i] < 9) {
      result[i]++;
      return result;
    }
    result[i] = 0;
  }
  return [1, ...result];
}


console.log(upArray(    [0,7]))
