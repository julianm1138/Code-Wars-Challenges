Task
Given Two integers a , b , find The sum of them , BUT You are not allowed to use the operators + and -

Notes
The numbers (a,b) may be positive , negative values or zeros .

Returning value will be an integer .

Javascript: the Array reduce methods are disabled, along with eval, require, and module .


// We can solve this using bitwise operators to perform low-level addition without the additive operators. 
// Every time we use XOR we get the binary sum of the two decimal numbers without any carry.
// Every time we use AND we get every carry.
// If we shift each carry left using << we eventually modify x by carrying all bits to replace the value of x. The process repeats until y is 0, which means all carries have been shifted left and accumulated into the decimal sum.
// In other words on each iteration x is updated to be the sum without any carries and y is updated to be the carry shifted left.


function add(x, y) {
  
  while (y !== 0) {
    let binarySum = x ^ y;
    let carry = ((x & y) << 1);
    x = binarySum;
    y = carry;
    
  }
 console.log(x)
}
console.log(add(5,3))
