Given the angle (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in 12 hour HH:MM format. Round down to the nearest minute.

//Since every hour is proportional to 30 degrees we can divide by 30 to get the hour and use % 30 to get the remainder for minutes.
//Format for hour < 10 and hour === 0 and format for minute < 10.
//Return the combined string. 




ar whatTimeIsIt = function(angle) {
let hour = Math.floor(angle/30), minutes = Math.floor((angle%30)*2);
if (hour < 10){hour = "0"+ hour;}
if (hour <= 0){hour = 12;}
if (minutes < 10){minutes = "0" + minutes;}
  return hour + ":" + minutes;
}
