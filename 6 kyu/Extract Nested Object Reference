You are given a complex object that has many deeply nested variables. You don't want to go the usual if obj.property == null route. Create a prototype method that given a nested path, either return the value or undefined.


//We can use Lodash's get method to access nested objects, we just have to specify the object we are accessing and the value we are searching for.




Object.prototype.hash = function(string) {
  
  const _ = require('lodash');
  
  return _.get(this, `${string}`);
  
}
