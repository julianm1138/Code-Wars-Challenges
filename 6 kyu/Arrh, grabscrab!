Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.

For example:

grabscrab( "ortsp", ["sport", "parrot", "ports", "matey"] )
Should return ["sport", "ports"].

Return matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty array if there are no matches.

//We can solve this by sorting the anagram and dictionary word then converting to string to prevent comparing different object references in memory.


function grabscrab(anagram, dictionary) {
  
  let result = [];
  
  for (const word of dictionary) {
    if (anagram.split('').sort().join('') === word.split('').sort().join('')) {
      result.push(word);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
