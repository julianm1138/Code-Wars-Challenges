Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like th


//We can set up conditions for each array length and for the final one we can use the length of the array minus the 2 elements to give us the count greater than 2 in an array with 4 or more names.




function likes(names) {

  
  if(names.length === 0){
    return "no one likes this";
    } else if(names.length === 1){
      return `${names[0]} likes this`;
    } else if(names.length === 2){
      return `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`;
    } else if(names.length === 3){
      return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`;
    } else {
      return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names.length - 2} others like this`;
    }
  }
