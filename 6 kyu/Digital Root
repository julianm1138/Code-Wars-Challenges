Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

//We can use a while loop for digits less than 10 and turn each input into an array.
//Then we define our sum and for loop for the array.
//Then we add each element to the sum and assign n to be the sum.
//If the sum is still >= 10 then the while loop will continue. 





function digitalRoot(n) {
  
    while (n >= 10) {
      
        let numArr = n.toString().split('');
  
        let sum = 0;
      
        for (let i = 0; i < numArr.length; i++) {
            sum += Number(numArr[i]);
        }
     
        n = sum;
    }
   
    return n;
}
console.log(digitalRoot(16))
