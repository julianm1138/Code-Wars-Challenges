"Imagine I have between m and n Zloty..." (or did he say Quetzal? I can't remember!)
"If I were to buy 9 cars costing c each, I'd only have 1 Zloty (or was it Meticals?) left."
"And if I were to buy 7 boats at b each, I'd only have 2 Ringglets (or was it Zloty?) left."
Could you tell me in each possible case:

how much money f he could possibly have ?
the cost c of a car?
the cost b of a boat?


//There is the possibility that m be greater than b in the input, so we can correct that with destructuring.
//We can solve this by looping through the range and checking if each value has a remainder of 2 (for b) and 1 (for c). Given modular congruences, if they pass the tests we will subtract 2 and 1 from the value respectively and divide by their respective divisors as given to us in the problem. 
//Using this approach helps us eliminate computations that check every value from m to n and helps keep the solution efficient. 
//Given the tests pass we push the results to the array for each value of f.


function howMuch(m, n) {
  
  let result = [];
  
  if (m > n) [m, n] = [n, m];
  
  for (let f = m; f <= n; f++) {
    
    if (f % 7 === 2) {
      let b = (f - 2) / 7;
    
    if (f % 9 === 1) {
      let c = (f - 1) / 9;
      
    result.push([`M: ${f}`,`B: ${b}`,`C: ${c}`]);
    }
