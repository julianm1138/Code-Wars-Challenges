Given a string made of digits [0-9], return a string where each digit is repeated a number of times equals to its value.

Examples
"312" should return "333122"

//We need to return a string where each digit in the original string is repeated the number of times equal to its value.
//The repeat method can take either a string or number as an argument and repeat the target for that amount of times.
//We can loop through the string and create an empty string to create our result string.
//Then we add each new string to the empty string using repeat.
//We target the current element in the loop and repeat that element for the value equal to that element. 
//So if the current element was "3" we target it with repeat and use "3" as an argument so the ouput should be "333".




function explode(s) {
  
  let result = '';
  
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
    result += s[i].repeat(s[i])
  }
  return result;
}
console.log(explode("312"))
