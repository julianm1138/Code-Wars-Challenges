//This was a debugging challenge where parseInt was not being called correctly and we were missing the map method's callback function. 


var parseNumbers = function(intStrs) {
  return intStrs.map(parseInt);
}


//I added a callback function to the map method and fixed the parseInt syntax. 

var parseNumbers = function(intStrs) {
  return intStrs.map(element => parseInt(element));
}
