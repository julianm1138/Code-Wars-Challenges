Given a positive integer n, calculate the following sum:

n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ...
All elements of the sum are the results of integer division.


//We can create a loop that cotinues as long as n >= 1 and divide each iteration by 2 and floor it.
//Update the variable with each iteration and add the value of each iteration to the result with the assignment operator.







function halvingSum(n) {
    let result = 0;
    let current = n;
    
    while (current >= 1) {
        result += current;
        current = Math.floor(current / 2);
    }
    
    return result;
}
console.log(halvingSum(3))
