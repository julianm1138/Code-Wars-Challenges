Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.

Task
Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, where the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2.


//So we need to alternate the each team member between team 1 and team 2, where the first element of the array starts at team 1, then alternates from there.
//Each element of the input array is the weight of the respective places.
//So we can make two counts, loop through the array and make a condition where if it is the first element (i = 0) add it to team 1's count, else to team 2's count.
//We make the condition to check if i is even because the first element starts at i = 0 and then it alternates from there.
//Return our new array.



function rowWeights(array){
  
  let team1Weight = 0;
  
  let team2Weight = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    if (i % 2 === 0){
      team1Weight += array[i];
    } else {
      team2Weight += array[i];
    }
  }
  return [team1Weight, team2Weight]
}
console.log(rowWeights([100,50]))
