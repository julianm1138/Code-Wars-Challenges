Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.

//We know that we can only boil 8 eggs at a time and it takes 5 minutes per 8 eggs.
//This means that between a range of multiples of 8, we have to add 5 every time it passes a multiple of 8.
//We can find the time in minutes to boil the eggs if we divide the eggs given by 8 and mutliply that by 5.






function cookingTime(eggs) {
   return Math.ceil(eggs / 8) * 5;
  }

console.log((cookingTime(17)))


//Alternatively, we can use a for loop with the incrementor set to += 8 to act as a range for each input and add 5 every time the input surpasses 8 and falls within the new range created.

function cookingTime(eggs) {
  
  let minutes = 0;
  
  if (eggs === 0){
    return 0;
  }
   
    for (let i = 0; i < eggs; i += 8){
      minutes += 5;
   }
  return minutes;
  }
console.log((cookingTime(5)))
