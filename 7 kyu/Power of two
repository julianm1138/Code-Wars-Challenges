Complete the function power_of_two/powerOfTwo (or equivalent, depending on your language) that determines if a given non-negative integer is a power of two. From the corresponding Wikipedia entry:

a power of two is a number of the form 2n where n is an integer, i.e. the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and integer n as the exponent.

You may assume the input is always valid.

//We need to return true if 2 ** n is a power of 2.
//We can define a power of 2 as being any even number when divided by 2 continuously will eventually evaluate to 1. 
//So we can handle our base cases first for when n is a negative number or 0. 
//Then we can use a while loop to keep dividing n by 2 until it is 1 if n is even. 
//The loop will exit when n becomes 1.



function isPowerOfTwo(n){
    
  if (n <= 0) {
    return false;
  }

  while (n % 2 === 0) {
    n = n / 2;
  }


  return n === 1;
  }
