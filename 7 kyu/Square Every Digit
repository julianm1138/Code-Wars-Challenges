Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

Happy Coding!

//We know that we need to square each digit in the input and then join them back together.
//First we make the string array.
//Then we make the array of squared numbers.
//Lastly, thanks to type coercion we can divide the result by 1 to convert it back into an integer and return the result. 



function squareDigits(num){
  const strArr = num.toString().split('');
  console.log('Array of strings:', strArr);
  const squareArr = strArr.map(element => parseInt(element, 10) ** 2);
  console.log('Squared array:', squareArr);
  const result = squareArr.join('')/1
  return result;
}
console.log(squareDigits(3212))
