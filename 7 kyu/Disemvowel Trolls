Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

//We make an array of vowels and empty string and save it in a variable
//Loop through the string
//If the current element is NOT a vowel append it to the empty string and return the result 

function disemvowel(str) {
  const vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'];
  let result = '';
  
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (!vowels.includes(str[i])) { 
                                                   
      result += str[i];
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}
