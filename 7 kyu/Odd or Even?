function oddOrEven(array) {
  
  const sum = array.reduce((acc, current) => acc + current, 0);
  return sum % 2 === 0 ? "even" : "odd";
   //enter code here
}

//instructions: Given a list of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.

Give your answer as a string matching "odd" or "even".

If the input array is empty consider it as: [0] (array with a zero).


//I like to use varibales when I can to keep the code readable and organized. 
//First we create the sum logic. 
//Next we create logic to check if the sum is even or odd. Return it. Easy.
