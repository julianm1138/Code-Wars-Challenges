Complete the solution so that it takes the object (JavaScript/CoffeeScript) or hash (ruby) passed in and generates a human readable string from its key/value pairs.

The format should be "KEY = VALUE". Each key/value pair should be separated by a comma except for the last pair.


//We can loop through the object's keys and push each key and value in the correct format to an empty array and then join it. 
//We cannot return the template literal right away because it will terminate the loop after the first iteration.






function solution(object){
  
  let result = [];
  
  for(let key in object){
      result.push(`${key} = ${object[key]}`)
    }
  return result.join(",");
}
console.log((solution({'a': 1, 'b': 2})))
