Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!


//We know we need to get all the values between two positive or negative integers and then get all the values in between and including those two integers. 
//We can get the min and max from the inputs to establish a range, then use a for loop to increment from a to b inclusive, and push all values to an empty array.
//Finally, we can use reduce() to sum all elements in the array. 


function getSum(a, b){
  
  let highNum = Math.max(a, b)
  
  let lowNum = Math.min(a, b)
  
  let newArr = []
  
  for (let i = lowNum; i <= highNum; i++){
    newArr.push(i)
    
  }
  console.log(`Every value between and including ${lowNum} and ${highNum}`, newArr)
  const result = newArr.reduce((acc, currentValue) => {
    return acc + currentValue
    }, 0) 
  
  
  if (a === b){
    console.log(`Values are the same the anwer is:`)
  } else {
  console.log(`The sum of all values is:`)
    }
  return result 
  }



console.log(getSum(-5, 2))


//a b -> 1  2  3  4 = return 10 
//a b -> 1 === 1 = return 1
