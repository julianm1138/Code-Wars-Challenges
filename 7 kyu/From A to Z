Given a string indicating a range of letters, return a string which includes all the letters in that range, including the last letter.
Note that if the range is given in capital letters, return the string in capitals also!

Examples
"a-z" ➞ "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
"h-o" ➞ "hijklmno"
"Q-Z" ➞ "QRSTUVWXYZ"
"J-J" ➞ "J"


//We can use destructuring assignment to target the first and last index of the array when we split it. 
//We store the first and last letter in a variable and select their unicode values with charCodeAt. We do this so we have a numerical values to compare in the for loop.
//Finally, we use a for loop to continue to push the unicode values between the range and then convert it back to a string. 



function gimmeTheLetters(range) {
  const [start, end] = range.split('-');
  const startCode = start.charCodeAt(0);
  const endCode = end.charCodeAt(0);
  
  let result = '';
  for (let i = startCode; i <= endCode; i++) {
    result += String.fromCharCode(i);
  }

  return result;
}
