Write a function that takes a positive integer n, sums all the cubed values from 1 to n (inclusive), and returns that sum.

Assume that the input n will always be a positive integer.

//We need to loop from 1 to n and cube each iteration.
//We can do that using a for loop and then get the sum by assigning each cube to 0.



function sumCubes(n){
  
  let result = 0;
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    result += i ** 3;
    console.log('i cubed:', i ** 3)
  
  }
    console.log('The sum:')
    return result;
}
console.log(sumCubes(2))
