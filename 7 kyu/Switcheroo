Given a string made up of letters a, b, and/or c, switch the position of letters a and b (change a to b and vice versa). Leave any incidence of c untouched.

//We can loop through the string and replace every instance of 'a' with 'b' and vice versa. Else leave the current element as is. 
//We can use map to make this slightly cleaner than a for loop, we just have to split the string into an array first.



function switcheroo(x){

 return x.split('').map(element => {
   if (element === 'a') return 'b';
   if (element === 'b') return 'a';
   return element;
 }).join('');
  }
  
 
console.log((switcheroo('abc')))
