Write a small function that returns the values of an array that are not odd.

All values in the array will be integers. Return the good values in the order they are given.


//We need to iterate through the array and return every element that is even.
//Filter seems like the best fit here.



function noOdds( values ){
  
  return values.filter(element => element % 2 === 0);
}
