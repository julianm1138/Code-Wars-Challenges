Given an integer as input, can you round it to the next (meaning, "greater than or equal") multiple of 5?

Examples:

input:    output:
0    ->   0
2    ->   5
3    ->   5
12   ->   15
21   ->   25
30   ->   30

//A multiple of 5 is anything that can be divided by 5 with no remainder. 
//If we round n divided by the target mutliple up to the nearest whole number and mutliply it by the target multiple it should give us a multiple of that number.







function roundToNext5(n){

  return Math.ceil(n / 5) * 5;
    
  }
console.log(roundToNext5(21))
