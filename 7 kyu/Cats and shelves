An infinite number of shelves are arranged one above the other in a staggered fashion.
The cat can jump either one or three shelves at a time: from shelf i to shelf i+1 or i+3 (the cat cannot climb on the shelf directly above its head).
Find the minimum number of jumps to go from start to finish



//We can only go i + 3 or i + 1, so as long as we are between start and finish/less than the finish, we add 3 to i else add 1 to i, and every time either of those happen, we increase the count by 1.




function solution(start, finish){ 
  
  let result = 0;
  
  for(let i = start; i < finish;){
    if(i + 3 <= finish){
      i += 3; 
    } else {
      i += 1;
    }
    result += 1;
  }
  return result;
}
