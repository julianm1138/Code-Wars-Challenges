Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

Your function would return the following array:

["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.


//We need to sort the strings into ascending order based on string length. The problem is, if we use .length property alone then it will convert the string in the array into a number.
//But if we use .length on the sort() method's arguments, it will not modify the original string. 


function sortByLength (array) {
  // Return an array containing the same strings,
  // ordered from shortest to longest
  
  return array.sort((a,b) => a.length - b.length)
  
}
console.log(sortByLength (['bbb', 'a'  , 'cccc']))
