//This was a debugging challenge where the syntax was invalid. It looks corrrect at first if you use React a lot because in React you reference props/objects with curly braces and dot notation, just like here. 

var data = [
  {name: 'Joe', age: 20},
  {name: 'Bill', age: 30},
  {name: 'Kate', age: 23}
]

function getNames(data){
  return data.map(function(item){item.name});
}

//I used an arrow function and removed the curly braces, so it should target the name property correctly now. 

function getNames(data){
  return data.map(item => item.name);
}
