Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.

The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: begin, end, step.

If begin value is greater than the end, your function should return 0. If end is not the result of an integer number of steps, then don't add it to the sum. See the 4th example below.

Examples

2,2,2 --> 2
2,6,2 --> 12 (2 + 4 + 6)
1,5,1 --> 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
1,5,3  --> 5 (1 + 4)

//We have to start at begin, end at end, and increment by step.
//We can set up a varibale to keep track of the total.
//Finally, we can set up a for loop with the iterator set to begin, iterate up to end, and increment by the step.
//So we define how the sequence works with the iterator, and the iterator itself will be the count and the total sum of the sequence. 


const sequenceSum = (begin, end, step) => {
  
  let result = 0;
  
  for (let i = begin; i <= end; i+= step){
    result += i
    console.log(i)
  }
  
  console.log(`result:`)
  return result;
  
};
console.log(sequenceSum(2, 6, 2))
