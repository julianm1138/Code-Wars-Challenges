In this kata, we will be using a more complicated sequence: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ... This sequence is generated with the pattern: "the nth term is the sum of numbers from 0 to n, inclusive".

[ 0,  1,    3,      6,   ...]
  0  0+1  0+1+2  0+1+2+3
Your Task
Complete the function that takes an integer n and returns a list/array of length abs(n) + 1 of the arithmetic series explained above. Whenn < 0 return the sequence with negative terms.

Examples
 5  -->  [0,  1,  3,  6,  10,  15]
-5  -->  [0, -1, -3, -6, -10, -15]


//We can define a sum, iterate from 0 to n inclusive, and update the sum with each current value of the sum + i. 
//To handle negative numbers, I chose to multiply i by -1 to make each sum negative, but you can alternatively use a decrementing for loop to create the negative version of each sum's result. 
//In either case, we push each sum to the empty list. 




function sumOfN(n) {
  
  let result = [];
  let sum = 0;
  
  if(n < 0){
    for(let i = 0; i <= Math.abs(n); i++){
    sum += i * -1;
    result.push(sum);
   }
  }
  
  for(let i = 0; i <= n; i++){
    sum += i;
    result.push(sum);
  }
 
  return result;
}
  
console.log(sumOfN(-7))
