In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples
highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"
Notes
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.


//So I knew we had to convert the string into integers and then obtain the min and max values and return those as a string. 
//If we split the input into an array separated by spaces, it should retain an array of whole numbers, regardless of sign. 
//We then need to get a new array of those strings as an array of integers so we use map and parse them in base 10. 
//Use spread operator to get the min and max values, and thanks to type conercion if we concatenate the min and max values with a string it will turn the whole thing into a string. 

function highAndLow(numbers) {
  const strArr = numbers.split(' ');
  const numArr = strArr.map(element => parseInt(element, 10));
  const minValue = Math.min(...numArr);
  const maxValue = Math.max(...numArr);
  const result = maxValue.toString() + " " + minValue.toString();
  return result;
}
