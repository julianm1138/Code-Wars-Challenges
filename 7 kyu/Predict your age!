In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
Multiply each number by itself.
Add them all together.
Take the square root of the result.
Divide by two.
Example
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86

//This one is pretty straightforward, we have to mutliply each argument against each other and then just follow the instructions.



function predictAge(age1,age2,age3,age4,age5,age6,age7,age8){
  
  
  let multiplyArr = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++){
    multiplyArr.push(arguments[i] * arguments[i])
  }
  
  let sum = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < multiplyArr.length; i++){
    sum += multiplyArr[i];
  }
  
 return Math.floor(Math.sqrt(sum)/2)
}

//Here is a more concise version using spread operator, map, and reduce. 

function predictAge(...ages) {
  const sumOfSquares = ages.map(age => age * age).reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
  return Math.floor(Math.sqrt(sumOfSquares) / 2);
}
