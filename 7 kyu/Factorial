n mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. By convention the value of 0! is 1.

Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input.


//We know we need to iterate from 5 to 1 and multiply each i by the next. 
//With multiplication, order does not affect the result so we can make a loop that goes from 1 to and including n. Now we need a variable to keep track of the result's total value.
//We define the starting point for the result to be 1 because 1 * i will not make the loop be stuck at 0, but if we started at 0 it would because anything times 0 is 0.
//We use the assignment operator to update the result at each iteration. 


function factorial(n){

  let result = 1;

  if(n < 0 || n > 12){
    throw new RangeError('Value must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 12')
  }
  
  
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    
console.log(result *= i)

  }
 return result;

}
  

console.log(factorial(5))


//Alternatively you could use a decrementing for loop but it is a little harder to read. 
//Also if you use a decrementing for loop you have to specify to return 1 when n === 0 because once again anything times 0 is 0 so you'll be stuck returning 0. 

function factorial(n){

  let result = n;
  
  if(n === 0){
    return 1;
  }
  
  if(n < 0 || n > 12){
    throw new RangeError('Value must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 12')
  }
  
  
 for (let i = n - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
    result *= i;
  }
 return result;

}
  

console.log(factorial(0))
