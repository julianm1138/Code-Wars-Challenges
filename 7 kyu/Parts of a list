Write a function partlist that gives all the ways to divide a list (an array) of at least two elements into two non-empty parts.

//We can use a for loop for the input array and use slice inside of an array to create the two parts.
//Finally we will push the two parts array to an empty array.
//The first part will use slice(0, i) go from the first element until the last for each iteration to slice out 0 to i and exclude anything else outside of that.
//The second part will use slice(i) to slice out every element up to i. 







function partlist(arr) {
  
  
  let result = [];
  
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
    result.push([arr.slice(0, i).join(' '), arr.slice(i).join(' ')])
    console.log(`first part:`, arr.slice(0, i))
    console.log(`second part:`, arr.slice(i))
  }

  return result;
  
}
console.log(partlist(["I", "wish", "I", "hadn't", "come"]))
