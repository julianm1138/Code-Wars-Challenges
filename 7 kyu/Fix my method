//This was a bebugging challenge with some typos and the method was not named/defined.

//Original: 
function myFunction() {
  var MyObject = {
    objProperty: "string"
    objMethod: function() {
      return myObject.objProperty;
		}
  }
  
  return myObject.Objmethod();
};

//Corrected: 

//I added a comma in the object, named the method, and corrected typos. 
function myFunction() {
  var MyObject = {
    objProperty: "string",
    objMethod: function() {
      return myObject.objProperty;
		}
  }
  
  return myObject.Objmethod();
};
