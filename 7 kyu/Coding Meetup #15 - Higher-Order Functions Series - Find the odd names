write a function that when executed as findOddNames(list1) returns only the developers where if you add the ASCII representation of all characters in their first names, the result will be an odd number:

// We can solve this by looping through the array of objects and then for each character of the object's firstName we need the sum of the ASCII values. 
// At each iteration of the array reset the sum and check if the sum is odd, if yes, push to the result.
// At each iteration of the characters add the ASCII value to the sum. 




function findOddNames(list) {
  let result = [];
  for (const object of list) {
    let sum = 0; 
    for (const char of object.firstName) { 
      sum += char.charCodeAt(0);
    }
    if (sum % 2 === 1) { 
      result.push(object); 
    }     
  }
  return result;
}
