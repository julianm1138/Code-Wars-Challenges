Find the number of Friday 13th in the given year.

Input: Year in Gregorian calendar as integer.

Output: Number of Black Fridays in the year as an integer.


//We can use the new Date() constructor to dynamically create every 13th of every month of every year inputted.
//First we loop from 0 to 12 to represent every month in the year.
//Then we define our new date which generates every 13th of the month by using the year parameter.
//If the day is Friday, which is represented by a 5, add 1 to the count, then return the count. 





function unluckyDays(year){
  let count = 0;
  
  for(let month = 0; month < 12; month++){
    let date = new Date(year, month, 13);
    
    if (date.getDay() === 5){
      count += 1;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
