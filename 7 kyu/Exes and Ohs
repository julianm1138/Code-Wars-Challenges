Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

//We know we need to count the instances of "x" and "o" and if the number of "x" === number of "o" return true.
//We want to count x and o regardless of casing so we convert the whole string into lowercase. 
//We can define two counters, loop through the string, and add 1 to each counter depending on the current character. 
//Finally we use implicit return for the boolean value, and we get our solution. 

function XO(str) {
  str = str.toLowerCase();
  
  let oCount = 0;
  let xCount = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] === "o") {
      oCount += 1;
    } else if (str[i] === "x") {
      xCount += 1;
    }
  }
  
  return oCount === xCount;
}
