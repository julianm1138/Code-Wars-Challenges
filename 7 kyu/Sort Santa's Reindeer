Write a function that accepts a sequence of Reindeer names, and returns a sequence with the Reindeer names sorted by their last names.

Notes:
It's guaranteed that each string is composed of two words, separated by a single space
In case of two identical last names, keep the original order

// We can solve this using the sort method.
// First, we need to be able to access the last names of each reindeer, so split every two names into arrays so we can access the last names.
// Then we can use localCompare to compare each last name alphabetically.

function sortReindeer(reindeerNames) {
  
  const nameArr = reindeerNames.map(reindeerName => reindeerName.split(' '));
  const sortedArr = nameArr.sort((a, b) =>  a[1].localeCompare(b[1]));
  const result = sortedArr.map(element => element.join(' '))
 return result;
  
}
