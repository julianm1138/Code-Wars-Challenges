Find the number with the most digits.

If two numbers in the argument array have the same number of digits, return the first one in the array.

//We can compare the lengths of each of the digits if they are strings, and use a for loop to get the longest string.
//We convert the array to an array of string using map.
//We can set up longest to be the first element.
//Iterate through the array of strings, and if the current element's length is greater than the length of the first element, reassign longest to be that string.
//By the end of the loop, it should have the longest string inside that variable, so we just need to return it as a number. 





function findLongest(array){
  
  const strArr = array.map(element => element.toString());
  
  let longest = strArr[0];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < strArr.length; i++){
    if (strArr[i].length > longest.length){
      longest = strArr[i]
    }
   }
  return Number(longest);
}

console.log(findLongest([1000, 2000, 2400]))
