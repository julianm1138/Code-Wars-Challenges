In abstract set theory, a construction due to von Neumann represents the natural numbers by sets, as follows:

0 = [ ] is the empty set
1 = 0 ∪ [ 0 ] = [ 0 ] = [ [ ] ]
2 = 1 ∪ [ 1 ] = [ 0, 1 ] = [ [ ], [ [ ] ] ]
n = n−1 ∪ [ n−1 ] = ...
Write a function that receives an integer n and produces the representing set.

//We need to create an array of structures where each structure is mapped to the index of the array before it. 
//0 defines the first structure, which is just [].
//We can solve this problem using recursion. 
//We set a base case for when n is 0. 
//If the base case is not met we will create the array of integers for the length of n (the solution in the middle) as given in the examples. 2 = 1 ∪ [ 1 ] = [ 0, 1 ] = [ [ ], [ [ ] ] ].
//In the next part of the code we will then create an array of those integers mapped to their structure.
//So if we want to create [0 , 1] we use a for loop that goes up to n and push each element into its empty array. 
//To convert each element into a structure we need to make another for loop that will iterate through those elements and push strucutres starting from 0 = [] to an empty array depending on n. 
//Each element of [0, 1] is stored in num and then passed into the function repSet again. 
//0 is passed into repSet and returns an empty array in the result array
//1 is passed into repSet and creates an empty array in the first loop because it only has [1] in the list and [1] is converted to [0] which is then converted to [] and that is pushed to the result array. 
//So the first element of the result array is [] and the second element is [[]] which all becomes [ [], [[]]] ] 




function repSet(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return []
  }

  const list = []
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) { list.push(i) }

  let result = []

  for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    const num = list[i]

    let solution = repSet(num)
    result.push(solution)
  }

  return result
}
