Otherwise, without 'this' it is searching for a global variable named hive when none exist. Also, you need 'this' to update instances of hive in which the amount of pollen varies. 
If you don't use 'this' for the specific instance it will also call the global amount of pollen defined, which is the fixed property value of 100.*/
