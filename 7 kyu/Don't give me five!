n this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!

Examples:

1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12


//We know we need to iterate from start to end and count the presence of every number except any number that contains 5 in it. 
//We can loop from start to end and convert each number to string and check if that string does not include '5' at all. 
//If it does not, increment the count by 1. This should effectively remove all counts of any number that contains 5.




function dontGiveMeFive(start, end) {
  
  let count = 0;
  
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    if (!String(i).includes('5')) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  
  return count;
}
 
console.log((dontGiveMeFive(4,17)))
