function addBinary(a,b) {

   const sum = a + b; 
  
  return sum.toString(2);
  
}

//Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))

1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)


//This one was sort of straightforward, I just had to look up a method that would turn the input into base 2. 
//Add the arguments together. 
//return the sum in base 2 using toString.
