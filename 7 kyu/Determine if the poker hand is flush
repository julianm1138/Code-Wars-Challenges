Determine if the poker hand is flush, meaning if the five cards are of the same suit.

Your function will be passed a list/array of 5 strings, each representing a poker card in the format "5H" (5 of hearts), meaning the value of the card followed by the initial of its suit (Hearts, Spades, Diamonds or Clubs). No jokers included.

Your function should return true if the hand is a flush, false otherwise.


// We can solve this by checking if each card's suit is equal to the target suit.
// Define the suit variable which will get the final character of each string/card.
// Using the every method, check if every card's suit equals the first card's suit.

function isFlush(cards) {
  
 
  const firstCardSuit = cards[0][cards[0].length - 1];
  

  return cards.every(card => card[card.length - 1] === firstCardSuit);

}
console.log(isFlush([  "QD", "4D", "10D", "KD", "5D" ]))
