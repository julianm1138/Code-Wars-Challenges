Write a function that accepts fight string consists of only small letters and return who wins the fight. When the left side wins return Left side wins!, when the right side 
wins return Right side wins!, in other case return Let's fight again!.



//We need to add up the corresponding letters and values and return the string on which side won depending on which side has the greater count.
//We make two objects to map the characters to their values.
//We set up 2 counts.
//Set up a for loop where if the current character in the string exists in each object, add its value to the corresponding count.
//Conditional returns the winner as a string.





function alphabetWar(fight){
  
  const rightWeapons = {
    'm': 4,
    'q': 3,
    'd': 2,
    'z' : 1
  };
  
   const leftWeapons = {
    'w': 4,
    'p': 3,
    'b': 2,
    's' : 1
  };
  
  
  let rightCount = 0;
  let leftCount = 0;
  
  
 for (let i = 0; i < fight.length; i++) {
    let char = fight[i];
    if (char in rightWeapons) {
      rightCount += rightWeapons[char];
    } else if (char in leftWeapons) {
      leftCount += leftWeapons[char];
    }
  }
  return (rightCount > leftCount) ? "Right side wins!" : (leftCount > rightCount)  ? "Left side wins!" : "Let's fight again!";
}
console.log(alphabetWar("z"))
