Determine the area of the largest square that can fit inside a circle with radius r.

//We need to find the relationship between the given radius and the area of a square.
//1 radius is equal to half a square side.
//2 radii is equal to one full square side. Therefore, a square's side is 2r.
//A square has four sides, there we can square 2r^2 to get 4r^2.
//So the relationship between the circle radius and square area is 4r^2.

//This expression gives us twice the expected value is each test so we can just divide it by 2. 


function areaLargestSquare(r) {
  
  return (4*r**2)/2;
  
}
console.log(areaLargestSquare(15))
