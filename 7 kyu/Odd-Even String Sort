Given a string s, your task is to return another string such that even-indexed and odd-indexed characters of s are grouped and the groups are space-separated.
Even-indexed group comes as first, followed by a space, and then by the odd-indexed part.

//We can make an even and an odd group and loop through the string.
//If the index is even add it to the even group, else add to the odd group.
//Concatenate both groups with a template literal. 





function sortMyString(string) {
  
  let evenGroup = '';
 
  let oddGroup = '';
   
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++){
    if(i % 2 === 0){
      evenGroup += string[i];
    } else {
      oddGroup += string[i];
    }
  }
  return `${evenGroup} ${oddGroup}`;
}
console.log(sortMyString("CodeWars"))
