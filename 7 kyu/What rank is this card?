The function takes a string like '2c' or 'Kh' and returns a value based on rank of the card. The first character corresponds to the rank of the card and the second character corresponds to the suit of the card. Cards 2-9 should return the corresponding number. T returns 10, J => 11, Q => 12, K => 13 and A => 14. Otherwise the rank should be returned as 0.

For example:

rank('2c') == 2;
rank('Tc') == 10;
rank('As') == 14;
rank('1c') == 0; // There is no card '1'
Suits can be disregarded.

// Since suits can be disregarded, we just need to examine the first character of the input string.
// Also since numbers are only valid between 2 and 9 inclusive, we can do a conditional check for those and put all the face cards into an object for constant time lookup.
// For all other cases return 0


function rank(card) {

  const faceCards = {
    T: 10, J: 11, Q: 12, K: 13, A: 14
  };
  
  const rank = card[0];
  
  if (Number(rank) >= 2 && Number(rank) <= 9) {
    return Number(rank);
  } else if (faceCards[rank]) {
    return faceCards[rank];
  }
  return 0;
}
