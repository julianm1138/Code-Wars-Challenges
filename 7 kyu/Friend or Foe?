Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]


//We know we need to return a new array where if the element.length === 4 return that element and exlucde all other elements from the new array.
//There are two ways we can solve this, one with map and one with filter. 
//The first solution that came to mind was map(). We can return undefined and then use filter for all falsy values. 
//The shorter and more straightforward is to use filter() which will return a new array where we don't need to specify which value to return other than element.length === 4. 




function friend(friends){
  
 return friends.map(element => element.length === 4 ? element : undefined).filter(Boolean);
  
}


function friend(friends){

 return friends.filter(element => element.length === 4);
  
}
