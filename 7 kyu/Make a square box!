Given a number as a parameter (between 2 and 30), return an array containing strings which form a box.

// Given the example we can tell that the first part of the square is '-' repeted n times, the parts in between are '-' + ' ' repeated n - 2 times + '-' (this sequence is repeated n - 2 times), and the final part is just '-' repeted n times again.
// We can define an array and complete each part step by step which will build the result.




function box(n) {
   
  let result = [];
 
 result.push('-'.repeat(n))
  
  for (let i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
    result.push('-' + ' '.repeat(n - 2) + '-');
 }
  result.push('-'.repeat(n));
  
  return result;
}
