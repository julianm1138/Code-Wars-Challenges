The first input array is the key to the correct answers to an exam, like ["a", "a", "b", "d"]. The second one contains a student's submitted answers.

The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer, represented as an empty string (in C the space character is used).

If the score < 0, return 0.


//We need to return the total score based on comparing each element based on position in each array. So we iterate through the first array and check if the curent element === second array's current element.
//I used a for loop and made a condition for each time we subtract or add points to the score.
//Finally we say if the score is less than 0 return 0, else return the score.








function checkExam(array1, array2) {
  
 let score = 0;
  
 
  for (let i = 0; i < array1.length; i++){
    if (array2[i] === ""){
      score += 0;
    } else if(array1[i] === array2[i]){
      score += 4;
    } else {
      score -= 1;
    }
  }
   if (score < 0){
      return 0;
    } else {
      return score; 
    }
   
}


console.log((checkExam(["b", "c", "b", "a"], ["" , "a", "a", "c"])))
