Complete the method which accepts an array of integers, and returns one of the following:

"yes, ascending" - if the numbers in the array are sorted in an ascending order
"yes, descending" - if the numbers in the array are sorted in a descending order
"no" - otherwise

//We should keep in mind that JS checks memory allocation and content with the comparison operator simultaneously, so...
//We need to make copies of the array to create new arrays in memory because if we don't, JS would use comparison by memory allocation and always return true.
//Then we need to stringify the arrays to compare contents as opposed to comparing memory allocation again, because in this case it would always return false. 


//JS memory allocation comparison problem x2
//Once in the copy portion (line 18-19)
//Twice in the comparison portion (line 21)
