The blocksize is a by a and a ≥ 1.

What is the perimeter of the nth shape in the sequence (n ≥ 1) ?


//The pattern is that when n === 1 the perimeter is 4 and the perimeter increaes by 4 every time n increases by 1.
//Given this, we can set up a loop that starts at the first shape (when n === 1) and add 4 to the perimeter on each iteration up to n. 
//We multiply the total perimeter of n by a to account for blocksize.



function perimeterSequence(a, n) {
  
    let perimeter = 0; 

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        perimeter += 4;     
    }

    return perimeter * a; 
}
console.log(perimeterSequence(3, 3))
