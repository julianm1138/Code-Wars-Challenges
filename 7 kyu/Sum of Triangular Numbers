Your task is to return the sum of Triangular Numbers up-to-and-including the nth Triangular Number.

Triangular Number: "any of the series of numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc.) obtained by continued summation of the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc."




//We can loop from 1 to n and use the equation for the sum of triangular numbers.
//We add each iteration to 0.



function sumTriangularNumbers(n) {
  
  let result = 0;
  
  for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
   result += (i * (i + 1)) / 2;
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(sumTriangularNumbers(4))
