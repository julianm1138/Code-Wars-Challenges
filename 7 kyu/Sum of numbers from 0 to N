We want to generate a function that computes the series starting from 0 and ending until the given number.

//We need to output a string with every iterator up to n and concatenate it with the result.
//We handle the edge cases listed in the challenge first.
//Then we make our for loop and define a sequence and the result.
//One line calculates the result and the other creates the string sequence.
//Finally return the sequence concatenated with the result.



var SequenceSum = (function() {
  function SequenceSum() {}

  SequenceSum.showSequence = function(count) {
    if (count === 0){
      return `0=0`
    }
    
    if(count < 0){
      return `${count}<0`
    }
    
    let sequence = '';
    
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= count; i++) {
     
      result += i;
      sequence += (i === 0) ? `${i}` : `+${i}`;
    }
    
   return `${sequence} = ${result}`;
  };

  return SequenceSum;
})();
