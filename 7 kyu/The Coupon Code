Your mission:
Write a function called checkCoupon which verifies that a coupon code is valid and not expired.

A coupon is no more valid on the day AFTER the expiration date. All dates will be passed as strings in this format: "MONTH DATE, YEAR".


//This problem has two parts to it: make sure the coupon entered is equal to the correct coupon and make sure the current date is less than or equal to the expiration date.
//We can use the new Date contructor to convert each date into a value of milliseconds.
//After that we can use implicit return for both the coupon code and the expiration date.



function checkCoupon(enteredCode, correctCode, currentDate, expirationDate){
  
  
  currentDate = new Date(currentDate)
  console.log(currentDate)
  expirationDate = new Date(expirationDate)
  
  return enteredCode === correctCode && currentDate <= expirationDate;
}
