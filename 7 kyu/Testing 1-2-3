Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

Examples: (Input --> Output)

[] --> []
["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]


//We know we need to put each number stating from 1 to the end of the array in front of each element of the original array.
//We also know that we can define i to be any number and iterate through the array length. 
//So we can get an array of [1, 2, 3] depending on the length of the array.
//All we need to do is push our desired format/string to an empty array. We can use template literals to do so. 








var number=function(array){
  
  let newArr = [];
  
  for (let i = 1; i < array.length + 1; i++){
   newArr.push(`${i}: ${array[i - 1]}`)
    
  }
 return newArr

 
}
console.log(number(["a", "b", "c"]))
