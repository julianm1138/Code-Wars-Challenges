Your goal in this kata is to define if two differents DNAs sequences code for exactly the same protein. Your function take the 2 sequences you should compare. For some kind of simplicity here the sequences will respect the following rules:

It is a full protein sequence beginning with a Start codon and finishing by an Stop codon
It will only contain valid tri-nucleotide.
The translation hash is available for you under a translation hash $codons [Ruby] or codons [Python and JavaScript].


// We can solve this by creating triplets for each DNA sequence and looking them up in the codon hashmap provided by JS.
// Compare the triplets' value in the hashmap.



function codeForSameProtein(seq1,seq2){
  
  function makeTriplets(sequence) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < sequence.length; i += 3) {
      result.push(sequence.substr(i, 3));
    }
    return result;
  }
  
  const tri1 = makeTriplets(seq1);
  const tri2 = makeTriplets(seq2);

  
  for (let i = 0; i < tri1.length; i++) {
    if (codons[tri1[i]] === codons[tri2[i]]) {
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
  return true;

}
