Given an array of integers , Find the maximum product obtained from multiplying 2 adjacent numbers in the array.

//We need to find the product of every adjacent element in the array and return the max value of them. 
//We can use map to find the product of the current element and the next element of the original array.
//We also need to use slice to avoid an out of bounds error from map. ([index + 1] will try to access the next element even if one does not exist.)
//Finally we use Math.max to get the max value.




function adjacentElementsProduct(array) {
  
  const arr = array.slice(0, -1).map((element, index) => element * array[index + 1]);
  console.log(arr)
  
  return Math.max(...arr)
  
}
console.log(adjacentElementsProduct([5, 8]))
