We want to know the index of the vowels in a given word, for example, there are two vowels in the word super (the second and fourth letters).

So given a string "super", we should return a list of [2, 4].

Some examples:
Mmmm  => []
Super => [2,4]
Apple => [1,5]
YoMama -> [1,2,4,6]
NOTES
Vowels in this context refers to: a e i o u y (including upper case)
This is indexed from [1..n] (not zero indexed!)

//We need to return an array of integers representing the index of each character that is a vowel.
//We can loop through the string and check if each element of the array includes a vowel.
//We define a vowel string to cover upper and lower case and an empty array.
//We follow the instructions that this array is not to be zero indexed, so we shift it by 1.



function vowelIndices(word){
  
  let result = [];
  
  const vowel = 'aeiouyAEIOUY';
  
  for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++){
    if(vowel.includes(word[i])){
      result.push(i + 1);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
console.log((vowelIndices("apple")))
