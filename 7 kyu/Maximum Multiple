Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,

Conditions :
N is divisible by divisor

N is less than or equal to bound

N is greater than 0.

Notes
The parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only positive values .
It's guaranteed that a divisor is Found .
Input >> Output Examples
divisor = 2, bound = 7 ==> return (6)


//We can loop from 0 to the bound and return the greatest number that meets the conditions. 




function maxMultiple(divisor, bound){
 
  let result = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i <= bound; i++){
    if(i % divisor === 0 && i <= bound && i > 0){
      
      result = i;
      
    }
    
  }
  
  return result;
}
console.log((maxMultiple(2,7)))
console.log((maxMultiple(3,10)))
