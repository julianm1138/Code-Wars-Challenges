function solution(str, ending){
  
return str.endsWith(ending);
}

//Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

//This one is scary if you don't know about the endsWith method. Otherwise its super simple. Ending is passed as an argument as per the instructions. 
//So literally, str endswith the ending. Pretty cool.
