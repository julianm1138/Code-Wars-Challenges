Complete the solution so that it returns the greatest sequence of five consecutive digits found within the number given. The number will be passed in as a string of only digits. It should return a five digit integer. 
The number passed may be as large as 1000 digits.

//We need to make a sequence of 5 digits throughout the entire string and convert that into an integer.
//We iterate through the string and create a substring of every iterator up to length 5 of the string.
//We convert each one to an integer using parseInt.
//Finally we set up a condition that's very similar to finding the greatest value using a loop where if the current number is greater than the result it will be updated until it reaches the largest value.
//This works essentially because we get every possible sequence of 5 up to the end of the array and the condition will always return the greatest value of every sequence created.

/*Note: in the for loop if we wanted we could specify anything from digits.length - 4 to digits.length and it will still work because since the sequences iterate by 5 and only need to go through the whole string, 
even if they cut off past the last element in the string it can still get each full sequence of 5 digits of the string from index[0] to full the length.
