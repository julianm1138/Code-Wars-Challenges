//This challenge was missing this. dot notation to reference each parameter in the constructor function. 
//It also passed the tests but on the attempt there was an extra space for single inputs, for example expected 'Clint' got 'Clint ' 
//So to get rid of all whitespace we target the concatentation expression and use the trim method
