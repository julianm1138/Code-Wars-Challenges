In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); 
you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).


//We know we have to map each letter in the DNA sequence to its corresponding letter.
//I went with the most straightforward way I could think of, loop over the input, and if the letter is equal to its matching letter, add the matching letter to the empty string.





function dnaStrand(dna){
  
  let result = "";
  
  for (let i = 0; i < dna.length; i++){
    if(dna[i] === "A"){
     result += "T"
    } else if(dna[i] === "T"){
      result += "A"
    } else if (dna[i] === "G"){
      result += "C"
    } else if (dna[i] === "C"){
      result += "G"
    }
  }
  return result;
}
