Given a list of digits, return the smallest number that could be formed from these digits, using the digits only once (ignore duplicates).

//We need to return an integer of the least possible value you can create with integers in the array, and we have to ignore duplicates.
//In order to do this we can remove duplicates and then sort the array in ascending order. We can remove duplicates using the Set constructor.
//Sorting the array in ascending order will ensure that every array will create the smallest possible number based on ordinal numbers. 
//For example, if we put [2, 3, 1] in order from least to greatest it will always create the smallest number possible because you put the smallest number as the most significant digit.
//Finally we join it to a string and divide by 1 to convert the string into a number.





function minValue(values){
  
 const sortedArr = [...new Set(values)].sort((a, b) => a - b);

 return sortedArr.join('')/1;
  
}
