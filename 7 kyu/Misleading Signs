Your friend is smart, but he can't know what he doesn't already know, he only knows a certain amount of letters in sign language. Given the word on the shirt, the word you are attempting to make your friend believe is on the shirt, and the letters in sign language your friends knows, figure out if he can tell that you are fooling him. Return true if your friend can figure out you are fooling him, otherwise return false.

It is guaranteed that both words will be the same length and will be in lowercase letters (a-z)

Example 1:
Word on shirt: snack
Word you said: snake
Letters your friend knows: [c]

return true
Your friend knows the 4th letter is a c rather than a k.
If the word on the shirt and the word you told your friend is the same then you aren't fooling your friend, so you should return false

Example 2:
Word on shirt: snack
Word you said: snack
Letters your friend knows: [s, n, a, c, k]

return false 
Since you are not fooling your friend
Example 3:
Word on shirt: snake
Word you said: snack
Letters your friend knows: [c]

return true 
Your friend knows that the 4th letter is not a c
Example 4:
Word on shirt: smile
Word you said: smirk
Letters your friend knows: [s, m, i]

return false
Your friend doesn't know what the letters l and e from smi(le) look like in sign language.
So he cannot say that those letters are not r or k from smi(rk) because he wouldn't know
So your friend cannot figure out if you are fooling him.


//We only need to solve a single condition and then return the opposite boolean for the other scenario.
//If all the letters in both words match, then it must be false, so we will loop through one of the words and check if the current letter is not equal to the other word's current letter. 
//If so, then if the current letter includes the letters my friend knows, or if the current letter 

function gaslighting(shirtWord,yourWord,friendsLetters) {

  for (i=0; i < shirtWord.length ; i++){
    
    //Only if the letters are different
    if (shirtWord[i] != yourWord[i]){

          // If the current letter on the shirt includes the letters my friend knows or if the current letter of the word I said includes the letters my friend knows, return true, else return false
          if (friendsLetters.includes(shirtWord[i]) || friendsLetters.includes(yourWord[i]) )
            return true;
          }
      }
  }
  return false;
  }
