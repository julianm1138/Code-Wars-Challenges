Your task is to return a number from a string.

Details
You will be given a string of numbers and letters mixed up, you have to return all the numbers in that string in the order they occur.

//Given a string that may or may not have other characters besides numbers, we need to return the numbers inside the string as an integer.
//We can use the array method filter.
//First we convert the string to an array.
//Then we can pass the string array into filter and if the current character is a number we will keep it in the array, and then join it. 
//Finally we use unary plus operator to convert the string into a number.



var filterString = function(string) {
  
  const stringArr = string.split('');
  
  return +stringArr.filter((element) => !isNaN(element)).join('');
  
}
