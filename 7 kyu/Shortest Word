Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).

String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.

//We know we need to get the length of each string and then get the shortest length.
//First we split the string into an array of strings so we can map/iterate over the strings with .length
//Then we use Math.min() on each length
//return the .length of the string that has Math.min(element.length) 


function findShort(s){
 s = s.split(' ');
 const lengthArr = s.map( element => (element.length));
 console.log('Array of each string\'s length:', lengthArr)

 const result = Math.min(...lengthArr);
 console.log('The shortest length:', result)
 return result;
}
findShort("this is a sentence")
//"this is a sentence" -> 1
//"bitcoin take over the world maybe who knows perhaps" -> 3
