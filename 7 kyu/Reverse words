}

//Instructions: Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.


//I kept it concise as usual (when possible and when I don't want to or need to remember each part of the solution. Most of the time I want to to retain what I learn). 
//I used method chaining and I will lay out what happens at each part of the code. Input: "Buttercup cupcakes" we use split and split by spaces to create an array of words ['Buttercup', 'cupcakes'] and keep the spaces.
//We use map to create a new array and the logic inside map will make an array of the current string, because reverse does not work on strings. We use split again to split per character. 
//SO we have an array of however many characters/elements are inside Butterup cupcakes. It will reverse the elements/characters in the array and join them back into two elements. 
//Finally, we join the two elements back into one string, reversed while maintaining all spaces. 
//Done.
