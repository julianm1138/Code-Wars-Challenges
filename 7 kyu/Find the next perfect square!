Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

//We need to find the next square after a given square. 
//We know that if we square any positive integer and square root it then it will give us back the original number.
//Given that, if the input is a square root (is a positive integer after taking the square root of the input) we return the square root + 1 and then square that. 
//Adding 1 to the square root will give us the next positive integer which can in turn be squared, and if it is a positive integer that can be squared, it can be square rooted back. 
//So if we square the next positive integer after the input that gives us the next square. 






function findNextSquare(sq) {
  
  const squareRoot = Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(sq));
  //Make sure the input is a square root
  const nextSquare = (Math.sqrt(sq) + 1) ** 2;
  //The next perfect square is the (square root of input + 1) squared 
  
 if (squareRoot){
   return nextSquare;
 } else {
   return -1;
 }
}
console.log(findNextSquare(121))
