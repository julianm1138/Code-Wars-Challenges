This program tests the life of an evaporator containing a gas.

We know the content of the evaporator (content in ml), the percentage of foam or gas lost every day (evap_per_day) and the threshold (threshold) in percentage beyond which the evaporator is no longer useful. 
All numbers are strictly positive.

The program reports the nth day (as an integer) on which the evaporator will be out of use.

Example:
evaporator(10, 10, 5) -> 29


//The content is in mL, amount evaporated per day is a percentage, and the threshold is a percentage.
//The threshold is the amount where evapator becomes inefficient.
//The threshold is an amount based on the content, so we get the threshold by multiplying the content by that percentage.
//We can set up a count to keep track of the days and then a while loop to iterate as long as the content is greater than the threshold.
//Finally we update the content on every iteration with the new amount of gas lost (every time content is updated the relative amount lost will be different from the starting amount).





function evaporator(content, evap_per_day, threshold) { 
  threshold = (threshold / 100);
  let result = 0;
  
  const thresholdAmount = content * threshold;
  console.log(`Threshold amount: ${thresholdAmount} mL \n`)
 
  console.log(`Starting content amount: ${content} mL \n`)

  while (content > thresholdAmount) {
  
  const gasLost = content * (evap_per_day / 100);
  console.log(`New content amount: ${content} mL\n`)
  console.log(`Amount of gas lost: ${gasLost} mL\n`)
  
    content -= gasLost;
  
    result++;
  }
console.log(`\ndays:\n`)
  return result;

}

console.log(evaporator(10, 10, 5));
