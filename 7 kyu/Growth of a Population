In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater than or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?

At the end of the first year there will be: 
1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants

At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 
1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)

At the end of the 3rd year there will be:
1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213

It will need 3 entire years.
More generally given parameters:

p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to equal or surpass)

the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.

aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)

Examples:
nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15
nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10
Note:
Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.

There are no fractions of people. At the end of each year, the population count is an integer: 252.8 people round down to 252 persons.


//We know we need to get the amount of years it takes to reach p. 
//First, we know that percent is obtained by dividing by 100, so we assign percent to that expression. 
//Then we need 2 counters. One to keep track of p0 and one to keep track of how many years it takes to reach p. 
//Then we set up a loop that says while the starting point(p0) is less than the target p, we add the value it increases by with the expression (Math.floor(currentVal * percent)) + aug; 
//We use Math.floor to account for the floating point numbers we get when multiplying the currentVal by a percentage. 
//We add += 1 to the yearCount for each iteration as well.
//When the currentVal reaches p, the loop exits and finally we can return the yearCount. 



function nbYear(p0, percent, aug, p) {
   
  percent = (percent/100);
  
  let currentVal = p0;
  let yearCount = 0; 
  
  while (currentVal < p){
     currentVal += (Math.floor(currentVal * percent)) + aug;
    yearCount += 1;
   
    }
 return yearCount
}
console.log(nbYear(1000, 2, 50, 1200))
