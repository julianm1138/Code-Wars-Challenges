Given a string of words (x), you need to return an array of the words, sorted alphabetically by the final character in each.

If two words have the same last letter, the returned array should show them in the order they appeared in the given string.

All inputs will be valid.

// We can solve this by sorting by the last character of each vector. 

fn sort_by_last_char(s: &str) -> Vec<String> {

    let mut words = s.split_whitespace().collect::<Vec<&str>>();     // vector of words
    
    words.sort_by(|a, b| a.chars().last().cmp(&b.chars().last()));  // sort by the last character 
    
    words.iter().map(|word| word.to_string()).collect::<Vec<String>>()  // transform str slice into String
    
}
