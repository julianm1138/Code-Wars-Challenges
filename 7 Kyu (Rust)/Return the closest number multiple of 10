Given a number return the closest number to it that is divisible by 10.

Example input:

22
25
37
Expected output:

20
30
40

// We can solve this by rounding the number after dividing by 10, then multiply by 10 again to shift back to the correct place value. 

fn closest_multiple_of_10(n: u32) -> u32 {
    
    ((n as f64 / 10.0).round() * 10.0) as u32

}
