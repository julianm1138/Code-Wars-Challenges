Refactor the following code so that it belongs to a Person class/object. Each Person instance will have a greet method. The Person instance should be instantiated with a name so that it no longer has to be passed into each greet method call.



 struct Person {
    name: String,        
 }
    
    impl Person {
        
        fn new(name: &str) -> Self {
            
            Self {
              name: name.to_string(),
            }
        }
        
       fn greet(&self, other_name: &str) -> String {
        format!("Hello {}, my name is {}", other_name, self.name)     
     }
}
