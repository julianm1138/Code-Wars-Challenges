You will be provided a string that lists many boat related items. If any of these items are "Fire" you must spring into action. Change any instance of "Fire" into "~~". Then return the string.

// We can solve this with split and join. 
// Split via "Fire" to get an iterator with "Fire" missing
// collect into a vector to get a vector with "Fire" omitted 
// use join to connect the string slice with "~~"



fn fire_fight(s: &str) -> String {
 
    s.split("Fire").collect::<Vec<&str>>().join("~~")
}
