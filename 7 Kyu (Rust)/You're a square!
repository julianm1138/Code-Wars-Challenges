Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// We can solve this by checking if the square root of n is equal to the square root of n rounded down to a whole number.
// If they are equal then n must be a square number because if it wasn't it would be a float. 



fn is_square(n: i64) -> bool {
    
    let sqrt = (n as f64).sqrt();
    sqrt == sqrt.floor()
   
}
