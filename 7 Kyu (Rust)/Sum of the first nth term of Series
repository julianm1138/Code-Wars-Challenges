Your task is to write a function which returns the n-th term of the following series, which is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence (n is the input parameter).


// The series has a denominator increasing by 3.
// Create the numerator (which is always 1) and denominator which is always 1 + (3 * n).
// Repeat this from 0 to n (exclusive of n) and add to a sum variable. 



fn series_sum(n: u32) -> String {
    
    let mut sum = 0.0;
     
    for num in 0..n {
      
      let numerator = 1.0;
      let denominator = 1.0 + (3.0 * num as f32);
        sum += numerator / denominator;
    }
    
    format!("{:.2}", sum)

}
