Area of an arrow
An arrow is formed in a rectangle with sides a and b by joining the bottom corners to the midpoint of the top edge and the centre of the rectangle.


// We need the area of the arrow inside the rectangle. To calculate the area of an arrow we can observe the fractions inside the rectangle. 
// If we divide the rectangle horizontally we have 1/2 of the area. If we divide again we get 1/4 of the area. 
// The arrow's area is equivalent to 1/4 of the total area which means the area of the arrow is 1/4 of the total area.

fn arrow_area(a: u32, b: u32) -> f64 {          
a as f64 * b as f64 * 0.25      
}
