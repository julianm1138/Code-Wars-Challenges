Create function fib that returns n'th element of Fibonacci sequence (classic programming task).

// We can solve this by calculating the fibonacci sequence iteratively. 
// Add the base cases and move the new fibonacci number to b, and move the old b to a.

fn fib(n:u32)->u32{

    if n == 0 { return 0}
    if n == 1 {return 1}
    
    let mut a = 0;     //a = f(n - 2)
    let mut b = 1;     //b = f(n - 1)
    
    for _ in 2..=n {        // Execute the sequence this many times
        let temp = b;       // Keep the old b so we can reassign to a
         b = a + b;         // Assign to be f(n) = f(n - 2) + f(n - 1)
         a = temp;          // Assign the old b to a
        
    }
    b
}
