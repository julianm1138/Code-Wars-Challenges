Implement a function that takes two numbers m and n and returns an array of the first m multiples of the real number n. Assume that m is a positive integer.

// We can solve this by looping through the range of m and multiplying each range number by n.


fn multiples(m: i32, n: f64) -> Vec<f64> {
    
   let mut result = Vec::new();
    
    for num in 1..=m {
        result.push(n * num as f64);
    }
    
    result
}

//OR 

fn multiples(m: i32, n: f64) -> Vec<f64> {    
    
 (1..=m).map(|num| num as f64 * n).collect()

}
