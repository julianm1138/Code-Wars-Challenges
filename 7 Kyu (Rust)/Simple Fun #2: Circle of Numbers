Task
Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighbouring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighbouring, too).

Given n and firstNumber/first_number/first-number, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.


// We have the total distance of the circle as n.
// We also have the number to find the radial opposite of as fst.

// We can solve this by adding the distance needed to reach the oppposite of the radius to the given number. 
// In cases where the first number would push the sum out of bounds we use modulo to loop back around and stay inside the bounds of n.
