Write a function that takes a positive integer n, sums all the cubed values from 1 to n (inclusive), and returns that sum.

Assume that the input n will always be a positive integer.

// We can solve this by looping through a range or using the sum of cubes formula.


fn sum_cubes(n: u32) -> u32 {

    let mut result = 0;
    for num in 1..=n {
        result += num * num * num;
    }
    result
}

fn sum_cubes(n: u32) -> u32 {

    let sum_of_nums = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    sum_of_nums * sum_of_nums
}
