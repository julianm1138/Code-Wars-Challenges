In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!


// We can solve this by checking if the current number in the range contains the digit 5 and not adding that to the count if it does.
// Otherwise add 1 to the count.


fn dont_give_me_five(start: isize, end: isize) -> isize {

    let mut count = 0;
    
    for num in start..=end {
          if num.to_string().contains('5') {
            continue;
        }  
        count += 1;      
    }
    count
}
