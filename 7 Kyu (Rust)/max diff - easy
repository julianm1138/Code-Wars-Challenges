You must implement a function that returns the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a given list / array (lst) received as the parameter.

lst contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers
if lst is empty or contains a single element, return 0
lst is not sorted

// We could sort it and get the first and last element, but instead we will get the min and max value. 

fn max_diff(numbers: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    
    if numbers.len() < 2 { return 0 }

    let mut min = numbers.iter().min().unwrap();
    let mut max = numbers.iter().max().unwrap();
    
    max - min
    
}
