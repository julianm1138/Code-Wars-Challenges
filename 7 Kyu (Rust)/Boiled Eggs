Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.


// Every egg takes 5 minutes, and since the max capacity is 8, every batch of 8 takes 5 minutes. 
// Therefore, eggs / 8 rounded up gives us the number of batches, then multiply the batches by 5.


fn cooking_time(eggs: u32) -> u32 {

   ((eggs as f32 / 8 as f32).ceil() as f32 * 5 as f32) as u32

}


// To avoid typecasting we could use the math ceil hack ceil(x / y) == (x + y - 1) / y

fn boil_time(eggs: u32) -> u32 {
    ((eggs + 7) / 8) * 5
}
