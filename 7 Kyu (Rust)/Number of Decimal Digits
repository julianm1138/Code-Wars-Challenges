Determine the total number of digits in the integer (n>=0) given as input to the function. For example, 9 is a single digit, 66 has 2 digits and 128685 has 6 digits. Be careful to avoid overflows/underflows.

All inputs will be valid.

// We can solve this by converting the integer to a string and then getting the count of iterators/chars since not every letter is guaranteed to be of length 1. 



fn digits(n: u64) -> usize {
  
    n.to_string().chars().count()
}
