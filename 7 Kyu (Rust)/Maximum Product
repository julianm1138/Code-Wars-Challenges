Given an array of integers , Find the maximum product obtained from multiplying 2 adjacent numbers in the array. Note that the array size is at least 2 and consists a mixture of positive, negative integers and also zeroes.

// We can solve this by multiplying each of the pairs and comparing it to the first pair.
// If the current pair is greater than the first pair, update it. This will give us the max product between each pair. 


fn adjacent_elements_product(xs: &[i32]) -> i32 {

  let mut max_product = xs[0] * xs[1];
    
  for pair in xs.windows(2) {
      let product = pair[0] * pair[1];
      if product > max_product {
      max_product = product;
    }
 }
  max_product
}
