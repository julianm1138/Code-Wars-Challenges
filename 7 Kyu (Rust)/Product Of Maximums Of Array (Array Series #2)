Given an array/list [] of integers , Find the product of the k maximal numbers.


// We need to find the max product of k numbers.
// We can solve this by sorting the array in descending order and getting the product of the first k numbers in that array. 


fn max_product(mut lst: Vec<i32>, k: i32) -> i32 {
    lst.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a)); 
    lst.into_iter().take(k as usize).product()
}
