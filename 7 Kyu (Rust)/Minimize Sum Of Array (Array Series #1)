Given an array of integers , Find the minimum sum which is obtained from summing each Two integers product .


// We can solve this by sorting the array and multiplying the first and last elements working inwards until there are no elements left.


fn min_sum(xs: &[u64]) -> u64 {
    
    let mut vec = xs.to_vec();   //Array is immutable so we convert to vector so we can sort it 
    vec.sort();
    
    let len = vec.len();
    let mut result = 0;
    
    for i in 0..(len) / 2 {                    // For 4 elements we only need two iterations because we are processing 2 elements per iteration.
        result += vec[i] * vec[len - 1 - i];
    }
    result
}
