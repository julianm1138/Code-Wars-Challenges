Task:
Your job is to write a function, which takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.

// We can solve this with a combo of filter and count.
// Filter every positive number and count exactly 2 of them.


fn two_are_positive(a: i32, b: i32, c: i32) -> bool {

    [a, b, c].iter().filter(|&&x| x > 0).count() == 2
    
}
