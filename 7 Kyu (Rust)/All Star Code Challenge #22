All Star Code Challenge #22

Create a function that takes an integer argument of seconds and converts the value into a string describing how many hours and minutes comprise that many seconds.

Any remaining seconds left over are ignored.

Note:
The string output needs to be in the specific form - "X hour(s) and X minute(s)"



fn to_time(seconds: u32) -> String {
     
    let total_minutes = seconds / 60;       // divide by 60 to get the total minutes
    let hours = total_minutes / 60;         // divide total minutes by 60 to get hours
    let minutes = total_minutes % 60;       // get the remainder of the total minutes 

    format!("{} hour(s) and {} minute(s)", hours, minutes)
}
