Input
Start and finish shelf numbers (always positive integers, finish no smaller than start)

Task
Find the minimum number of jumps to go from start to finish

// The cat can go a full 3 shelves or 1 shelf at a time.
// We need to find the minimum number of jumps needed to get to the finish 
// So we will need the distance and then how many big jumps the cat can make, and then how many jumps left over (if the finish is not a multiply of 3)

pub fn cats_and_shelves(start: u8, finish: u8) -> u8 {
     
    let mut distance = finish - start;
    
    (distance / 3) + (distance % 3)
  
}
