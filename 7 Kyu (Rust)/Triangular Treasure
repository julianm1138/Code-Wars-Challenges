Triangular numbers are so called because of the equilateral triangular shape that they occupy when laid out as dots.


// We can solve this by using the triangle number formula which takes the base number (n) of dots and multiplies it by the next number.
// Divide by 2 to address double counting.


fn triangular(n: i32) -> i32 {
    
  if n < 0 {
    return 0;
  }          
  (n + 1) * n / 2
}
