Your task is to write a function called valid_spacing() or validSpacing() which checks if a string has valid spacing. The function should return either true or false (or the corresponding value in each language).

// We can solve this by using the regex crate to replace all extra spaces with one space and trim all leading and ending spaces.


use regex::Regex;

fn valid_spacing(s: &str) -> bool {   
    
    s ==  Regex::new(r"\s+").unwrap().replace_all(s.trim(), " ")
    
}
