In this Kata your task will be to return the count of pairs that have consecutive numbers

// We can solve this by using chunks_exact which will go over the array slice in chunks of two and ignore the final digit in odd length arrays.

fn pairs(arr: &[i32]) -> usize {
    
    arr.chunks_exact(2)     // turn the arr into chunks of two i32's
    .filter(|pair| (pair[0] - pair[1]).abs() == 1)     // keep all pairs where the absolute value of difference of the pairs is 1
    .count() as usize   
   
}
