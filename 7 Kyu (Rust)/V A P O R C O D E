Write a function that converts any sentence into a V A P O R W A V E sentence. a V A P O R W A V E sentence converts all the letters into uppercase, and adds 2 spaces between each letter (or special character) to create this V A P O R W A V E effect.

Note that spaces should be ignored in this case.

// We can solve this by creating a new string. 
// Since we need to output a string that has two empty chars between each uppercase letter we can just convert everything to uppercase.
// Unless it is an empty character, push the character and two spaces
// Otherwise if c is an empty character, ignore it.

fn vaporcode(s: &str) -> String {

 let mut result = String::new();
 
 for c in s.to_uppercase().chars() {
     if c == ' ' {
     continue;
    } else {
      result.push(c);
      result.push_str("  ");
    }
}
      result.trim_end().to_string()
    }
