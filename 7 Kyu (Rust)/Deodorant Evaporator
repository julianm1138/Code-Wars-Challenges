This program tests the life of an evaporator containing a gas.

We know the content of the evaporator (content in ml), the percentage of foam or gas lost every day (evap_per_day) and the threshold (threshold) in percentage beyond which the evaporator is no longer useful. All numbers are strictly positive.

The program reports the nth day (as an integer) on which the evaporator will be out of use.


// We can solve this by incrementing the days while the threshold volume is less than the new content volume.


fn evaporator(content: f64, evap_per_day: i32, threshold: i32) -> i32 {

    let mut result = 0;
    let mut new_content = content;
    let threshold_volume = content * (threshold as f64 / 100.0);
    
    while threshold_volume < new_content {
        new_content = new_content - new_content * (evap_per_day as f64 / 100.0);
        result += 1;
    }
    result 
}
