Find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution.

The inputs x and y are always greater or equal to 1, so the greatest common divisor will always be an integer that is also greater or equal to 1.

// We can solve this by swapping the values of b as a % b and a until b == 0. 
// Whe b == 0 we have found the gcd.


fn gcd (mut a: u32, mut b: u32) -> u32 {

    while b != 0 {
        let temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
      a
}
