I will give you an integer. Give me back a shape that is as long and wide as the integer. The integer will be a whole number between 1 and 50.

// We can solve this by pushing the "+" repeated n times with a new line n times. 
// Trim the last new line.

fn generate_shape(n: i32) -> String {
    
   let mut result = String::new();
    
   for _ in 0..n {
       
   result.push_str(&"+".repeat(n as usize));
   result.push('\n');
   
    }
     result.trim_end().to_string()
}
