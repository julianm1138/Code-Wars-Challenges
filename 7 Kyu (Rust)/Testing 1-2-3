Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

// We can solve this by iterating over the list using the index and element to push a formatted string to an empty vector. 




fn number(lines: &[&str]) -> Vec<String> {

    let mut result = Vec::new();
    
    for (index, line) in lines.iter().enumerate() {
        result.push(format!("{}: {}", index + 1, line));  
    }
    result
}
