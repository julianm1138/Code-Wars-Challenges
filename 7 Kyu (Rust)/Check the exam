The first input array is the key to the correct answers to an exam, like ["a", "a", "b", "d"]. The second one contains a student's submitted answers.

The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer, represented as an empty string (in C the space character is used).

If the score < 0, return 0.

// We can solve this by comparing each string and conditionally adding to the score. 

fn check_exam(arr_a: &[&str], arr_b: &[&str]) -> i64 {

    let mut sum_of_scores = 0;
    
    
   for i in 0..arr_a.len() {
      
       if arr_b[i].is_empty() {
           
       } else if arr_a[i] == arr_b[i] {
           sum_of_scores += 4;
       } else {
           sum_of_scores -= 1;
       }
    }
      sum_of_scores.max(0)            // Make sure we cannot return a score < 0
}
