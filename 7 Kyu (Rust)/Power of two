Complete the function power_of_two/powerOfTwo (or equivalent, depending on your language) that determines if a given non-negative integer is a power of two


// Powers of 2 are simply stacks of 2's, so we can solve this by dividing x by 2 until it equals 1. If it does not equal 1 then it cannot be a power of 2.




fn power_of_two(mut x: u64) -> bool {
   
    if x == 0 {
        return false;
    }
    
    while x % 2 == 0 {
        x /= 2;
    }
    x == 1
    
}
