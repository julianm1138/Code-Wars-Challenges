In this Kata, you will be given two strings a and b and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings.

// We can check if any char in either string are not included in the opposite string. 


fn solve(a: &str, b: &str) -> String {

    let mut result = String::new();
    
    for c in a.chars() {
        if !b.contains(c) {
            result.push(c);
        }
    }
     for c in b.chars() {
        if !a.contains(c) {
            result.push(c);
        }
    }
    result
}
