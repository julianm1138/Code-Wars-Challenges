Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

// We can solve this by sorting by the length of each string.


fn sort_by_length(arr: &[String]) -> Vec<String> {
    
    let mut sorted = arr.to_vec();                // make this mutable so that we can rearrange the strings using sort_by
    sorted.sort_by(|a, b| a.len().cmp(&b.len()));  
    sorted
   
}
