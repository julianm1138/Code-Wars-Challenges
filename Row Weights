Task
Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array / tuple of two integers (depending on your language), whereby the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2. Note that the array will never be empty.

// Since we are switching between even and odd indexes to form each team, we can replicate that by letting team 1 be even indexes and team 2 be odd indexes.
// Return the teams as tuples.


fn row_weights(array: Vec<u32>) -> (u32, u32) {
    
    let mut team_1 = 0;
    let mut team_2 = 0;
    
    for (index, num) in array.iter().enumerate() {
        if index % 2 == 0 {
            team_1 += num;
        } else {
            team_2 += num;
        }
    } 
    (team_1, team_2)
}
