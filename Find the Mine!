Write a function mineLocation/MineLocation that accepts a 2D array, and returns the location of the mine. The mine is represented as the integer 1 in the 2D array. Areas in the 2D array that are not the mine will be represented as 0s.


// We can solve this by returning [i, j] when the matrix element is 1.


function mineLocation(field){
  
  for (let i = 0; i < field.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < field.length; j++) {
      if (field[i][j] === 1) {
        return [i, j];
      }
    }
  }
}
console.log(mineLocation([ [1, 0], [0, 0] ]))
