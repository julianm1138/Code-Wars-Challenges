function abbrevName(name){
  
  const words = name.split(' ');
  
  const initials = words.map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase()).join('.');

  return initials;

}




//Instructions: Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.
The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

patrick feeney => P.F

//We make sure that the input is split into two elements in an array for easy manipulation and because its a requirement to have a space in between the names. Ex. If we input Sam Harris we have ['Sam','Harris'] so far. 
//We then store the next step in its own variable and it contains the logic for getting the desired format. We use map to target the 0 index for each input, convert to uppercase, and join them back into a string with a period. 
//Return the result. Pretty clean if you ask me.
