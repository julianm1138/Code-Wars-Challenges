//For this one I decided to chain the methods to make it more concise. 
//Convert input to a string, split it into individual digits, reverse them, and then make a new array of the reversed numbers.
// If we wanted to be more particular we could have put the conversion to the array in its own variable but this seems simple and clear enough.
