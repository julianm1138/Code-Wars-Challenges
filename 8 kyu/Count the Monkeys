Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

For example(Input --> Output):

10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 1 --> [1]



//If we need to count from 1 to n and return a new array we can define an empty array and push each value to the empty array as needed.
//I used a for loop which starts the count from 1 and will iterate each number up to and including n.
//To do this, we set up a true condition to keep the loop going. if i = 1, then i <= n is true so the loop will keep going until it reaches n and using <= will make sure n is included. 
//Finally, the array method push is used to add each number up to and including n in the array and then it gets returned. 



function monkeyCount(n) {

  const result = [];
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    result.push(i);
  }
  return result;
}
