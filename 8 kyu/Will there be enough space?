//This one was kinda crazy for me but it made me a better problem solver. What I failed to do for this one at first was to consider that instead of just considering the examples, that on + wait = totalpassangers.
//I stored on + wait in a varibale to be reused in the function and make the function easier to read. 
//I used logic to satisfy the instruction requirements: If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take. 
//The passangers he can't take are the wait argument so totalpassengers - cap
