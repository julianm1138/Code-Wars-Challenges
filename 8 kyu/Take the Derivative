This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent.

Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. Then, it has to return an expression (like 28x^7). "^1" should not be truncated when exponent = 2.

//(arg 1 * arg 2) + (arg 2 - 1)
  //return string as (arg 1 * arg 2)x^(arg 2 - 1)
//This one is simple, we can just use order of operations and then coersion. 




function derive(coefficient,exponent) {
  return (coefficient * exponent) + 'x^' + (exponent - 1);
  
}
