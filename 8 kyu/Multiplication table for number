Your goal is to return multiplication table for number that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

For example, a multiplication table (string) for number == 5 looks like below:

1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50
P. S. You can use \n in string to jump to the next line.

Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end. If you're unsure about the format, look at the sample tests.



/*For me this was a formatting and syntax problem more than it was a technical problem. The problem was easy enough to solve, but not reading the note at the end made me wonder why my code wasn't working. 
After I added in the condition to exclude the newline for the last element the code was working as expected.*/ 



Things I learned: 

- Check all information in the description, including the notes 





function multiTable(number) {
 //return multiplication table for number that is always an integer from 1 to 10
  
let result = ''
 for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
  result += `${i} * ${number} = ${i * number}`;
   
   if (i < 10){
     result += '\n'
     }
   
  }
  
  return result;
  
}
