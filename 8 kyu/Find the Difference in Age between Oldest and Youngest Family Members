You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed ‘age’ of 0.
Return a new array (a tuple in Python) with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].

//store each expression in variables for easy access and readability
//use spread syntax to extract the values from the array and use each value in the methods






function differenceInAges(ages){
   const youngest = Math.min(...ages);
  const oldest = Math.max(...ages);
  const difference = Math.max(...ages) - Math.min(...ages);
  return [youngest, oldest, difference];
}
