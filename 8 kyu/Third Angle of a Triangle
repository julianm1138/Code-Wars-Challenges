/*This one just needed an algebraic equation with a specific order of operations set with parentheses, but otherwise we just needed to know that all sides of a triangle equal 180 degrees. 


function otherAngle(a, b) {
  
  //only positive integers are tested 
  
  //Function that finds the third angle of a triangle 
  const thirdAngle = 180 - (a + b);
 
  return thirdAngle;
}
