Things I learned: 
- You can use methods from the Math object, or just mathmetical operations in general to manipulate the output into what you need it to be as opposed to using a loop or condition. 


//I noticed the main pattern was when the condition is 100, the century was 1. So until you get to the thousands place, for every first index of the last year of the century,
then 100 = 1, 200 = 2, 300 = 3 then we get to 1700 = 17, etc. So based on the definition of a century, all bases are 100 so if you divide all by 100 and round up you'll get the correct century. 
  //Used Math.ceil method to get our needed output 




function century(year) {
  const findCentury = Math.ceil(year / 100);
  return findCentury; 
}
