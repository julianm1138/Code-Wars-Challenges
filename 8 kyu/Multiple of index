Return a new array consisting of elements which are multiple of their own index in input array (length > 1).

Some cases:
[22, -6, 32, 82, 9, 25] =>  [-6, 32, 25]

[68, -1, 1, -7, 10, 10] => [-1, 10]

[-56,-85,72,-26,-14,76,-27,72,35,-21,-67,87,0,21,59,27,-92,68]





/*The instructions here did not make much sense so I ran through every possible mathematical operation and then realized that in every test case after dividing the element by its index, the
returned array included elements from the input array that did not have a remainder.
 The test case where the element is 0 always returned 0 failed, so I included a condition just for that.*/

Things I learned: 

- to get an element from the input array to be returned as the result, simply set the element equaal to that element. 


function multipleOfIndex(array) {
  return array.filter((element, index) => element == 0 || element % index === 0)
}
