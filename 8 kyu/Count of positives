//Instructions: DESCRIPTION:
Given an array of integers.

Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 0 is neither positive nor negative.

If the input is an empty array or is null, return an empty array.

Example
For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15], you should return [10, -65].


//this one was more lengthy but still simple. Get an array as input, initalize a variable for positive and negative.
//if the elements are positive count the elements, but if they are negative, get the sum of all negative elements. 
//In other words, count all positives and sum all negatives.
