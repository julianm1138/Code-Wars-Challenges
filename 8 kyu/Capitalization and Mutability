Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. it must make the first character in the string upper case).

The string will always start with a letter and will never be empty.




function capitalizeWord(word) {
  
  return word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);
  
}
//Input is a word 
//capitalize first character in the string
//return new string


Things I learned: 

- toUpperCase() is a string method
- slice() method returns a new string and does not modify the original string
