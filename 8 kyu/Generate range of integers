Implement the function generateRange which takes three arguments (start, stop, step) and returns the range of integers from start to stop (inclusive) in increments of step.

//We can define and empty array and then create a for loop that includes the function's arguments as conditions in the loop.
//We set the range in the for loop by setting i to the stat of the range and it will continue until it is equal to the end of the rnge. Increment each element by the step/third argument.
//Finally we push everything in the context of the loop to the empty array and return the result. 


function generateRange(min, max, step){
  const result = [];
  for (let i = min; i <= max; i += step){
    result.push(i);
  }
  return result;
}

//input 3 integers
//output new array of all values in the range incrementing by step
