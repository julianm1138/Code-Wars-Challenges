Write a function that returns the total surface area and volume of a box as an array: [area, volume]

// The formula for the area of a rectangular prism is 2 (wl + hl + wh) and volume of a rectangular prism is whl.
// Depth is equal to the length.
// These formulas also pass for tests for cubes.


function getSize(width, height, depth) {
  
  const area = 2 * ((width * depth) + (height * width) + (height * depth));
  const volume = width * height * depth;
  
  return [area, volume];
}
console.log(getSize(10, 10, 10))  //[area, volume]
