Create a function that returns the CSV representation of a two-dimensional numeric array.

Example:

input:
   [[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
    [ 10,11,12,13,14 ],
    [ 20,21,22,23,24 ],
    [ 30,31,32,33,34 ]] 
    
output:
     '0,1,2,3,4\n'
    +'10,11,12,13,14\n'
    +'20,21,22,23,24\n'
    +'30,31,32,33,34'



/* This one was a little confusing because I didn't really know what CSV is and I got confused in the test cases because they seemed to return literally just the array as a string separated by commas except for the final element,
with the \n character after the final element of each array. But really it was just formatting for the output to be each array returned as a string with each element separated by commas and then separated by a new line. */







Things I learned: 
- What CSV is









function toCsvText(array) {
  
  const csvStrings = array.map(innerArray => innerArray.join(','));


  const csvResult = csvStrings.join('\n');

  return csvResult;
}


//I used map to create a new array of the inner arrays joined by commas and then joined those arrays with the newline character to remove the comma from the last element and return those inner arrays in new lines.
