Given an array add all the number elements and return the binary equivalent of that sum; to make the code bullet proof anything else than a number should be addeded as 0 since it can't be addeded

//input array
  //sum all elements
  //output return sum in binary 

//If the input array comtained booleans the tests failed so I use filter to exclude all booleans first
//then get the sum
//then convert the sum to binary



function arr2bin(arr){
  const keepNums = arr.filter(element => typeof element === 'number');
  const sum = keepNums.reduce((acc, currentVal) => acc + currentVal, 0);
  const result = sum.toString(2);
  
  return result; 
}

console.log(arr2bin([true,true,false,15]))
