20_year_estimate = one_year_total * 20

Your function should return the 20 year estimate of the stairs climbed using the formula above.

// The formula/answer is the total of all steps in a year times 20, and weeklyStairs is an array of weekdays each containing an array of steps
// We can get the sum of each of those weekday steps using map and reduce.
// Then we get the total sum of all the steps and multiply by 20.



function stairsIn20(weeklyStairs) {
 const sumOfSteps = weeklyStairs.map(weekday => {
  return weekday.reduce((acc, steps) => acc + steps, 0);
 });
 const totalSum = sumOfSteps.reduce((acc, steps) => acc + steps, 0);
 return totalSum * 20;
}
