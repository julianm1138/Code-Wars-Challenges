In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

// We can solve this by getting the product of array a and array b and getting the difference of absolute values.

function findDifference(a, b) {
  
  const getProduct = (nums) => {
    return nums.reduce((acc, currVal) => acc * currVal, 1);
  }
  
  const firstVolume = getProduct(a);
  const secondVolume = getProduct(b);
  return Math.abs(firstVolume - secondVolume);
  
}

console.log(findDifference([2, 2, 3], [9, 2, 3]))

// To do it in one line we can use the absolute value difference of reduce on a and b.

function findDifference(a, b) {

    return Math.abs(a.reduce((acc, currVal) => acc * currVal) - (b.reduce((acc, currVal) => acc * currVal)));
  
}

console.log(findDifference([2, 2, 3], [9, 2, 3]))
