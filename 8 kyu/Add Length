What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?

Example(Input --> Output)

"apple ban" --> ["apple 5", "ban 3"]
"you will win" -->["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]
Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element


//we can split the input into an array of words
//for each word add a space between it and the length of that word and return that as a new array



function addLength(str) {
  
const wordArr = str.split(' ');
  return wordArr.map(word => word + ' ' + word.length );
  }


//input a string
//output an array of strings
