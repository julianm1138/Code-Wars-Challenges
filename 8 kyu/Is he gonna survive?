A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return true if yes, false otherwise :)

/* The test cases made a bit more sense than the description but right away I noticed there was a ratio of 1 dragon to 2 bullets, then when I checked the test cases I realized that at least two or more bullets, 
then I wrote a conditional, ran the tests and they passed. */





function hero(bullets, dragons){
//1 dragon : 2 bullets 
  //at least double the bullets as many dragons or more
  
 if (bullets >= (dragons * 2)){
    return true; 
  } else {
    return false; 
  }
  //if he survives return true else return false 
}
