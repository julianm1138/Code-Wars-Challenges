ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

+ , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise.


function joinStrings(string1, string2){
   //return concantenated strings 
  return `${string1} ${string2}`
  
}
