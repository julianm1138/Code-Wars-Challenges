You must return the number of toast the you need to put in (or to take out). In case of 5 you can still put 1 toast in:

six_toast(5) == 1
And in case of 12 you need 6 toasts less (but not -6):

six_toast(12) == 6

//You just need the difference without any negative values, so I just used Math.abs()




function sixToast(num) {
  return Math.abs(num - 6);
}
