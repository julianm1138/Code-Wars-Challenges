Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

// If the current element is not equal to the previous element + 1 then it is not consecutive, so we should return that element. 
// In all other cases the array will be completely consecutive so return null. 


function firstNonConsecutive (arr) {

  for (const i in arr) {
   
    if (i == 0) continue;
    if (arr[i] !== arr[i - 1] + 1) {
      return arr[i];
    }
  }
    return null;
}
