Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained



/*This one was pretty simple. At first I tried a pattern using the test cases, ie. if a > c && b > c return a certain expression, but that didn't work and was too complicated.
We just need every combination of a, b, and c with the operators and brackets, so I just went with an array to hold all possibilities, 
which were all parameters added, then all multipied, then parenthesis on the left and right, then add mutliply, and multiply add and all variations of those two. 
Finally, out of all the combinations, we use Math.max and return it. I use variables for code clarity. 



function expressionMatter(a, b, c) {
 const combinations = [
    a + b + c,
    a * b * c,
   (a + b) * c,
    a * (b + c),
    a + (b * c),
    (a * b) + c,
   ];
  const maxVal = Math.max(...combinations);
  return maxVal;
  
  }
