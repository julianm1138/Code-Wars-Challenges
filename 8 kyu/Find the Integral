Create a function that finds the integral of the expression passed.

In order to find the integral all you need to do is add one to the exponent (the second argument), and divide the coefficient (the first argument) by that new number.

For example for 3x^2, the integral would be 1x^3: we added 1 to the exponent, and divided the coefficient by that new number).

Notes:

The output should be a string.
The coefficient and exponent is always a positive integer.

//I confused myself with the directions and put the arguments division background which only led to passing one test, but when I flipped them around it passed all the tests. 
//This problem was mainly a formatting one because the instructions tell you exactly what you need to do in terms of math. 





function integrate(coefficient, exponent) {
  //add +1 to the second parameter and divide first parameter by second parameter + 1 
  //output string 
  
 return coefficient / (exponent + 1) + "x" + "^" +  (exponent + 1);
  
}



Things I learned: 

- You can use toString() method to convert expressions to a string before the method. So for example (5 + 3).toString(); 
- in JS coersion applies when you use concatenation, so if a number is concantenated with a string the whole expression becomes a string.
