function summation(num) {
  
  return num === 1 ? 1 : num + summation(num - 1)
  // Code here
}



//instructions: Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example (Input -> Output):

2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

//Ternary operator for conciseness
//We take the input and use a recursive function to continously iterate the input and count down until 1 is reached. 
//For example, if you call the function with 4 as an argument, 4 does not equal 1 so it will run 4 + summation(4 - 1) until it reaches 1. All the values from the iteration are added together.
//Simple, yet really cool.
