Given a number n, return the number of positive odd numbers below n, EASY!

Examples (Input -> Output)
7  -> 3 (because odd numbers below 7 are [1, 3, 5])
15 -> 7 (because odd numbers below 15 are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13])
Expect large Inputs!



//A regular loop here is inefficient for large inputs so we have to play around with mathematically manipulating the input.
//If we divide the input by 2 and compare them to the examples, you'll notice that it is always at least the count of odd numbers.
//So we can use math.floor to return the count of odd numbers. 

function oddCount(n){
  return Math.floor(n/2);
}
