Your task is to change the letters with diacritics:

ą -> a,
ć -> c,
ę -> e,
ł -> l,
ń -> n,
ó -> o,
ś -> s,
ź -> z,
ż -> z
and print out the string without the use of the Polish letters.

//This challenge looks like it was made for OOP, so I went ahead and used an object to solve it. 






function correctPolishLetters(string) {
  const polishLetters = {
    ą: 'a',
    ć: 'c',
    ę: 'e',
    ł: 'l',
    ń: 'n',
    ó: 'o',
    ś: 's',
    ź: 'z',
    ż: 'z'
  };

  let result = '';

  for (const char of string) {
    result += polishLetters[char] || char;
  }

  return result;
}

Things I learned: 
- you can reference the current value with a for ... of loop (const char) or for loop (string[i])
