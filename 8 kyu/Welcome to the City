Create a method that takes as input a name, city, and state to welcome a person. Note that name will be an array consisting of one or more values that should be 
joined together with one space between each, and the length of the name array in test cases will vary.

//input 1 is an array has one or more values that should be joined together with one space in between 
//array length will vary 
//input 2 is string 
//input 3 is string 

//['John', 'Matt'] -> John Matt
//['George', 'Washington', 'Carver'] -> George Washington Carver 
//'Hello (name)! Welcome to (city), (state)!'


//To achieve these requirements, we can make a variable to store the joined array and then use concantenation with the variable inside as well as passing the other two arguments as template literlas. 

function sayHello( name, city, state ) {
  const joinedName = name.join(' ');
  return 'Hello,' + ' ' + joinedName + `! Welcome to ${city}, ${state}!`
}
