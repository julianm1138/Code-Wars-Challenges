const reverseSeq = n => Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => n - i);


Instructions: Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.

Example : n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]


//We know we need to iterate the input because its an nth term and we know we need to make a new array for the solution.
// An arrow function is used to keep it short. I use Array.from to make the new array and  length: n to iterate over n. Array.from is pretty cool because it comes with map inside of it. 
// For the nth term we know we need to count down so for the current index we take n - i. 
Done.
