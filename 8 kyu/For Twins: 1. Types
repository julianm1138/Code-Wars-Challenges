function typeValidation(variable, type) {
  //There are two parameters: variable and type.
  //return true if type matches the typeof the variable, else return false 
  
 return typeof variable === type;
  
}



/*This one tripped me up a little at first becuse I was checking if the typeof the variable (parameter) was equal to the typeof type (parameter) when I should have been checking if type of 1st parameter was equal
to the second parameter. The second parameter could be anything theoretically, so the function implicitly handles edge cases by using implicit boolean return. At first I went with explicit conditional statement but refactored it.

Things I learned: 

- typeof in JS is not a method but rather an operator. 
- The value or expression passed into typeof operator is called an operand.
