function removeExclamationMarks(s) {
  return s.replace(/!/g, "" );
}

//DESCRIPTION:
Write function RemoveExclamationMarks which removes all exclamation marks from a given string.


//I don't normally go for regex because most are harder to remember but in this case it makes the code more concise and the regex actually used is not too complicated so I decided to use it here. 
//Use delimiters to target exclamation marks. Use the global flag to target all instances of ! in the string. "" to replace all exclamation marks with nothing. Done.
