"I love you"
"a little"
"a lot"
"passionately"
"madly"
"not at all"
If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with "I love you" for 7 petals, "a little" for 8 petals and so on.

When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals is always greater than 0.


//Create an array or object 
//Shift the index so that it lines up properly. For example, if you put in 7 for the index, and there are 5 indices normally in the array, you want the correct string to the index. 
//So it should effectively shift the values to the left. 
//Use % to span the length of the data and stay within range
//Use bracket notation to return the string 



const petals = [
  "I love you",
  "a little",
  "a lot",
  "passionately",
  "madly",
  "not at all",
];

function howMuchILoveYou(index) {
  const normalizedIndex = (index - 1) % petals.length;
  return petals[normalizedIndex];
}


I learned: 

- Modulo % can be thought of as a tool for causing cyclic behavior
