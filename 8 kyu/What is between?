Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

For example:

a = 1
b = 4
--> [1, 2, 3, 4]

//We can define an empty array and push the current element to it if it meets a certain condition. 
//The condition is that starting from the first argument, if the first argument is less than or equal to the second argument we will continue to iterate.
//In other words, we can set up the loop to make the arguments the iterators. 

function between(a, b) {
  const result = [];
  for (let i = a; i <= b; i++){
    result.push(i);
  }
  return result;
}
