Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.

Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.


// We can calculate the amount of gallons remaining * miles per gallon to get the total amount of mileage available.
// If the mileage available is >= distance to the pump that means there is more than or enough mileage to reach the pump.
// Return mileageAvailable >= distanceToPump;



const zeroFuel = (distanceToPump, mpg, fuelLeft) => {
   
  const mileageAvailable = fuelLeft * mpg;
  return mileageAvailable >= distanceToPump;
  
};
console.log((zeroFuel(55, 25, 2)))
