Write a function that accepts arbitrary X and Y resolutions and converts them into resolutions with a 16:9 aspect ratio that maintain equal height. Round your answers up to the nearest integer.





function aspectRatio(x,y){
 
    return [Math.ceil(y * 16/9), y];
  
//2 arguments as integers 
  //All inputs and outputs have a common factor of 1.333333 for test cases 
  
}

Things I learned: 
- Sometimes the answer to the problem is inside the problem's statement itself.
