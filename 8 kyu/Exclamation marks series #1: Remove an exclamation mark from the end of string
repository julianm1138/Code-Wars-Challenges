Remove an exclamation mark from the end of a string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.


//We check if the last character in the string is "!" and if so, use slice to remove it. 


function remove (string) {
  if(string[string.length - 1] === "!"){
     return string.slice(0 , string.length - 1)
  } else {
  return string;
}
  }

Things I learned: 

- Slice and substring are used battle-ship like coordinates to remove parts of a string.
