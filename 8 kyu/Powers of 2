Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer n as input, and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).

//We can create an empty array and use the example cases to write our logic that pushes each value to our empty array. 
//In each example case the elements of the result array are formed by taking 2 to the power of the current element when looping from 0 to n inclusive. 





function powersOfTwo(n){

  const result = [];
  
  for(let i = 0; i <= n; i++){
    result.push(2 ** i);
  }
  return result;
}
//input is positive integer 
//output a list of all powers of 2 with exponent ranging from 0 to n inclusive
