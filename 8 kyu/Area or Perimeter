//You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter. Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.

//This one was easy. I opted for the variables approach. I defined what area and perimeter were. 
//I defined what a square and rectangle are per the instructions and finally wrote out the logic. I liked this one because once you define the varibales you just plug everything you need in and its super readable.
//Done. Easy.
