Task
Given a list of unique numbers sorted in ascending order, return a new list so that the values increment by 1 for each index from the minimum value up to the maximum value (both included).

// We can solve this by getting the min and max value and generating every value including the min and max using a loop.
// Push each value to an empty array.


function pipeFix(numbers){

  let min = Math.min(...numbers);
  let max = Math.max(...numbers);
  
  let result = [];
  
  for (let i = min; i <= max; i++) {
    result.push(i);
  }
  return result;
}
console.log(pipeFix([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 12 ]))
