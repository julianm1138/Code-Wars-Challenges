//Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

//Once again, this is an nth term problem so my brain goes to iterations for the n. I used a for loop for this one. 
//We need to get a string for the result so we initalize an empty string for the result. 
//Within the context of the for loop (which iterates n) we add s to the empty string and it should repeat that until the nth term is reached. 
//Return the result. Done.
