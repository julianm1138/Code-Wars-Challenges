/*This one was made very simple thanks to the includes method which conveniently allows you to use a conditional with it*/

Things I learned: 

-You are not allowed to store a conditional control flow in multiple variables and if you do store it in a variable, it is best to store it with let.





function defineSuit(card) {
  //depending on symbol return the suit of card 
  
 if(card.includes('♣')) {
    return 'clubs';
  }
        
  else if(card.includes('♦')) {
    return 'diamonds';
  }
   else if(card.includes('♥')) {
    return 'hearts';
  }
    
  else if(card.includes('♠')) {
    return 'spades'
  }
}


Refactored for conciseness: 

function defineSuit(card) {
  return card.includes('♣') ? 'clubs' :
         card.includes('♦') ? 'diamonds' :
         card.includes('♥') ? 'hearts' :
         card.includes('♠') ? 'spades' : null;
}
