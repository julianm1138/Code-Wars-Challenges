//This was a debugging challenge where the parameter parenthesis and the function's scope was not enclosed properly/had invalid syntax. 
//In addition to that, the function name in the code and the test cases did not match, and the conditional statements had some invalid syntax such as missing ? conditional operators and assigning values instead of using an equality operator
