//A classic. There are of course many ways to do this but I went with a more laid-out-right-in-front-of-you approach like I try to do as much as possible for most problems. 
//The trick to make this code work is to consider all possible conditions where the first player wins. If you meet all those, by process of elimination that only leaves all cases where the second player wins. 
//This is awesome because we only need to think through and code the p1 win conditions. 
//To get the p1 win conditions we need to think through all 3 options (r, p, s) and in what conditions do each of those win. 
//If p1 === p2 its a draw, otherwise p2 must have won.
