The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

1.08 --> 30
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.

// Since this function is only meant to convert km/hour to cm/s we can use const variables.
// The distance will be the input * meters in a km * cm in a meter (100,000 cm)
// The time will be 1 hour * 60 minutes in an hour * 60 seconds in a minute (3,600 seconds)
// cm/s floored will give us the result.


function cockroachSpeed(s) {
  
  const distance = s * 100000;
  const time = 3600;
  
  const result = Math.floor(distance / time);
  
  return result;
}
