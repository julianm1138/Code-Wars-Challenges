function positiveSum(arr) {
  
  return arr.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {

}, 0);
  }

DESCRIPTION:
You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

//Easy. We use reduce to check if the value of the one being processed is positive and return the sum, else we return the accumulator alone. Initalized to 0.
I always wished the intializer was at the beginning of the reduce method, but whatever. I'll take what I can get.
