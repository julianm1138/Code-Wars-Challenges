//This was a debugging challenge that had a few things wrong with it 
//First, the conditional was assigning a function to a value
//Second, it looks like they were either trying to create an object or a template literal on line 3. Third, there was a space before the final string " mm of water" 
//Last, if else is not valid syntax
//So I went through each issue and console logged the results until I got valid syntax and made adjustments based on the test errors from there.
