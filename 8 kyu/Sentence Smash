function smash (words) {
  
   return words.join(" ")
};


//Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!



//Pretty straightforward. We get an input array of separate strings as elements and we need to combine them or *cough cough* join them into a single string. 
//Let's use join method to join per space in the array. Done.
