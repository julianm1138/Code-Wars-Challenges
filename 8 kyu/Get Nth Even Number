Return the Nth Even Number

Example(Input --> Output)

1 --> 0 (the first even number is 0)
3 --> 4 (the 3rd even number is 4 (0, 2, 4))
100 --> 198
1298734 --> 2597466
The input will not be 0.


//All even numbers are mutliples of 2 and then we adjust the expression based on the solution requirements. (subtract 2)

function nthEven(n){
 return (2 * n) - 2;
}

//input is a non-zero integer
//output is an integer
