Write a function which calculates the average of the numbers in a given list.

Note: Empty arrays should return 0.

//If the length of the array is 0 it should be empty and each array and object in JS has a unique ID even if they are identical. 

function findAverage(array) {
  
  const sum = array.reduce((acc, currentVal) => acc + currentVal, 0);
  const count = array.length;
 if (count === 0){
    return 0;
 } else {
  return sum/count;
 }
}
