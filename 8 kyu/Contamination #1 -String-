An AI has infected a text with a character!!

This text is now fully mutated to this character.

If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.
There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!

Note: The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.

Example
text before = "abc"
character   = "z"
text after  = "zzz"


/*We can initialize an empty string and concatenate the char specified in the second argument for the length of the first argument.
To do this we can run a loop for the length of the first argument and then add the second argument to the empty string for the length of the first argument.*/ 



function contamination(text, char){
  
  let replacement = '';
  
  for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++){
   
    replacement += char
  }
  
 return replacement;
}
