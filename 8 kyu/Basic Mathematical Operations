function basicOp(operation, value1, value2)
{
  return {'+': value1 + value2, '-': value1 - value2, '*': value1 * value2, '/': value1 / value2}[operation]
  
  
  // Code
}


//This one was easy. I try to lean towards OOP when it feels right so I went ahead and made an object for this problem. 
//Each arithemtic operation is in the object, and since the function takes 3 arguments we define each property to have the value arguments actually do the operation.
// We use bracket notation to specifically access the inputted properties so it doesn't return every instance of value1 and value2.
