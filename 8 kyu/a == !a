Pass the tests:

a == false
!a == false
a == !a

/* I tried to manually assign with let here but that wasn't the right move but the kata itself might have had an isssue. 
For this one the test cases made no sense. For example in Test.assertEquals( a == false,  true, `a != false`); Two possible answers were const a = [] or const a = '0'. 
Both an empty array and a string evalulate to true in a boolean context. true == false is false, but the test case lists true. I'm probably not reading it right, I really don't know. But if you ignore everything except the string in the test case  `a != false` 
and compare the values that way, all test cases work. */ 

const a = [];
