Create a function that converts US dollars (USD) to Chinese Yuan (CNY) . The input is the amount of USD as an integer, and the output should be a string that states the amount of Yuan followed by 'Chinese Yuan'


//This one uses implicit coersion when concatenation is used and doesn't need toString() method. 







function usdcny(usd) {
  //input is integer
  //conversion rate 6.75 per 1 usd
  const conversion = usd * 6.75; 
  const result = conversion.toFixed(2) + ' ' + 'Chinese Yuan';
  return result; 
  //output is a string with 2 decimal places 
}
