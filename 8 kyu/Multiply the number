Jack really likes his number five: the trick here is that you have to multiply each number by 5 raised to the number of digits of each numbers, so, for example:

multiply(3) == 15 # 3 * 5¹
multiply(10) == 250 # 10 * 5²
multiply(200) == 25000 # 200 * 5³
multiply(0) == 0 # 0 * 5¹
multiply(-3) == -15 # -3 * 5¹

//So the key to figuring this one out is looking at the examples
//We need to mutliply the input by 5 and raise it to the power of the count of digits in each number
//We could use .length here but there are two problems: .length only works on strings and the length of a negative number would be one extra because it would include the negative sign 
//To solve these subproblems we can get the absolute value of any input and then convert it to a string.
//Finally we use .length on that expression and insert it into the function. 


function multiply(number){

  const length = String(Math.abs(number)).length;
 
  return number * 5**length;
  
}
console.log(multiply(-2))
