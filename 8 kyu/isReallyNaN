I've hit a few bugs in my Java/Type/Coffee-script code recently, and I've traced the problem back to the global isNaN function I was using. I had expected it to be more discerning, but it's returning true for undefined right now.

Write a function isReallyNaN that returns true only if passed in an argument that evalutes to NaN, and returns false otherwise.


//We can use Number.isNaN() part of the Number object to return false for all values that are not numbers (undefined)


const isReallyNaN = (val) => {
 return Number.isNaN(val)
};
