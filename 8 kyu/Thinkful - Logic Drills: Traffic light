You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

// We only have three states and given one of them we should return the next state.
// We can hold the states in an array.

function updateLight(current) {
  
  const lights = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'];
  
  if (current === 'green') {
    return lights[1];
  } else if (current === 'yellow') {
    return lights[2];
  } else {
   return lights[0];
  }
}

OR 

function updateLight(current) {
  
  const lights = ['green', 'yellow', 'red'];
  
  return current === 'green' ? lights[1] :
         current === 'yellow'? lights[2] :
                               lights[0];
}
