You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics

//input array
//sort in the correct order 
//output new array 
//we can explicitly reorder the array 


function fixTheMeerkat(arr) {
  
arr = [arr[2], arr[1], arr[0]];
  return arr; 
}
  



//or use array destructuring and the middle element should fill itself in

function fixTheMeerkat(arr) {
  
[arr[0], arr[2]] = [arr[2], arr[0]];
  return arr;
}
