//Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.

Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.

//this one's instructions made enough sense I guess, but the exmaples made no sense because let's say you have 5 classmates and 5 pages. How many blank pages do we need? I have no idea. So I went to the examples. 
//Here's one: n= 5, m=5: 25
//My question is how or why do we need 25 blank pages? If you have 5 pages then you would need 5 blank pages right? Wrong. This example says you need 25. But then again, I have no idea how many blank pages we need or how or why. 
//But I'm not too worried about it because I used the example and reverse engineered it to get the solution and it works so whatever. 
//So I simply used the example which is clearly 5 * 5 (no clue how or why you need this many blank pages or who the authority is on how many blank pages you need)
//So n * m and then If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0. Return totalPages. Easy, but once again deriving the expression for how many blank pages you need without using the example seems a bit too ambiguous.
