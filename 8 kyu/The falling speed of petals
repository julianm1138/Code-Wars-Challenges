When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called "sakura" and it's admired a lot. The petals start to fall in late April.

Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.

Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground from the same branch.

Notes:

The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.
Pay attention to the data types.
If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be 0





/*This one took me a while due to the wording "from the same branch." I feel like the wording could have been "the distance traveled from the specific branch is always the same." Otherwise I did notice 
the relaitonship between 1 second and 80 seconds per 5 cm traveled. So to solve this I kept in mind the relationship 5 cm per every second is proportional to 400 cm per every 80 seconds. 
Then I realized that the distance traveled by the petal between the branch and the ground is always the same. So we can model the function logic as time = 400 / v because there are 3 variables: time, distance, and velocity and we needed time. 
So I took time = 400 (the constant distance) / v (the only variable left to use). Edge case is when v === 0 because dividing by zero gives you positive infinity. */

function sakuraFall(v) {
  //time to reach the ground = 80 seconds from the same branch 
 const time = 400 / v;
  //the distance traveled is always the same 
  if (v < 0 || v === 0){
    return 0; 
    } else {
    return time; 
  }
    }
  //return time for petal to reach the ground
