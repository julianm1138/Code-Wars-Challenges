To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:

volume = Length * Width * Height

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!

It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).

Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.

Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).

Note: side will be an integer


//What is the defintion of a cube? All sides are equal. 
//volume = length * width * height
//input 1 is integer 
//input 2 is integer 
//return boolean if sides are equal 
//write the edge cases first "Return false for invalid numbers (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0)."
//if all sides of a cube are equal we could write that as the side argument, 1 side cubed. (side ** 3)
//V = sides**3 
//So we write a comparison between volume and all sides being equal (side**3) for implicit boolean return 

function cubeChecker(volume, side){
  if (volume <= 0 || side <= 0){
    return false;
  }
  return volume === side**3;
};
