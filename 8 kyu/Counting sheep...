Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

For example,

[true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]
The correct answer would be 17.

Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined

// We can solve this with a counter that increments when it reaches a truthy value, which undefined or null are not.  


function countSheeps(sheep) {
  
    let count = 0;
  for (let i in sheep) {
        if (sheep[i]) {
          count++;
        }
  }
    return count;
}
console.log(countSheeps([true, undefined, null]))
