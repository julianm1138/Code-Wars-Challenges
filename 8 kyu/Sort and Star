You will be given a list of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.



function twoSort(s) {
  return s.sort()[0].split('').join('***');
}

//input is array of strings
//sort it alphabetically *and return the first index* not ASCII value or any value at all. 
//return value as a string with "***" between each letter
