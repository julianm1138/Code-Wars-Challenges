Given an unsorted array of 3 positive integers [ n1, n2, n3 ], determine if it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using those 3 integers.

A Pythagorean Triple consists of arranging 3 integers, such that:

a2 + b2 = c2

//We sort first in ascending order so that all possible arrangements are equal to each other. 
//We can implicitly return true or false with the strict comparison operator. 


function isPythagoreanTriple(integers) {

  integers.sort((a,b) => a - b);
    return (integers[0] ** 2) + (integers[1] ** 2) === integers[2] ** 2;
  
}
