function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
  return name.toLowerCase().startsWith("r") ? name + " plays banjo" :
name + " does not play banjo";
}

//People get really creative with making these coding challenges. 

//Instructions: Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"

//I'm not gonna lie this one was kind of scary at first especially for being an 8 kyu so I was thinking I need to create a loop or something, but nah. JS methods have my back yet again. 
//Its clearly a conditional problem that returns strings based on either condition. 
//The main condition is if it starts with "r" regardless of casing, name + the first string is printed. Else name + second string is printed. Sometimes Code Wars instructiosn are just confusing but the problem was easy. 
//Shoutout to JS methods again featuring startsWith.
