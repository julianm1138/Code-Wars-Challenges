//instructions:

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).


//Here's a good old fashioned word problem. I define my variables so that I can use them throughout the function and make it easier to read. 
//Every day we rent the car it costs $40 so the basecost is $40. 
//The total is the number of days * basecost. 
//Then goes the conditional logic. If we rent for 7 or more days you get 50 off the total, else if we rent 3 or more days 20 off, else it stays the same.
