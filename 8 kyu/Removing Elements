Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Example:
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

// Every second element happens to be at an odd index, so if we filter the array to only keep even-indexed elements that will give us the answer.

function removeEveryOther(arr) {

  return arr.filter((_, index) => {
   return index % 2 === 0
  });

}
