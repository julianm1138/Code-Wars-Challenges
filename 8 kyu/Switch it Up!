When provided with a number between 0-9, return it in words. Note that the input is guaranteed to be within the range of 0-9.

Input: 1

Output: "One".

// We can solve this by accessing an array with each result given the number which works out to be a 0-based index. 

function switchItUp(number){
  
const words = ["Zero", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"];
  
  return words[number];
  
}
