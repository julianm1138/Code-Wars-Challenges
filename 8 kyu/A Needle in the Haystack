Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle


//we iterate the array
//we create a condition that returns the desired result by joining the index of 'needle' with the string. 


function findNeedle(haystack) {
  for (let i = 0; i < haystack.length; i++){
    if(haystack[i] === 'needle'){
      return 'found the needle at position ' + haystack.indexOf(haystack[i]);
    }
  }
}
