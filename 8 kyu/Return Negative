//"DESCRIPTION: In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?" Man. Just tell me what you want. You're not being mysterious or clever by being ambiguous. 
//anyway, they did end up giving me "The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required." Thank you. 
//Simple conditional logic solves this problem. Check if the input is really a number and is a positive integer and if so return it as a negative iteger. Else, do nothing. Done. Next.
