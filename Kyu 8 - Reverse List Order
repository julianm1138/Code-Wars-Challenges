function reverseList(list) {
const reverse = list.reverse();
  return reverse;
}

//This one was very simple, but I like to once again store my code inside variables so I can orgnaize and reuse if necessary. 
//For this problem I had to look up reverse so that I didn't have to use a loop or something unnecessarily complex, but its super simple, just invoke reverse method on the input and it does all the work.
